"clinical features of culture - proven mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at king abdulaziz university hospital , jeddah , saudi arabia .","objective : this retrospective chart review describes the epidemiology and clinical features of 40 patients with culture - proven mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at king abdulaziz university hospital , jeddah , saudi arabia . methods : patients with positive m. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from january 1997 through december 1998 were identified through the microbiology records . charts of patients were reviewed . results : 40 patients were identified , 33 ( 82.5 % ) of whom required admission . most infections ( 92.5 % ) were community - acquired . the infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants ( 32.5 % ) and pre-school children ( 22.5 % ) . it occurred year - round but was most common in the fall ( 35 % ) and spring ( 30 % ) . more than three - quarters of patients ( 77.5 % ) had comorbidities . twenty - four isolates ( 60 % ) were associated with pneumonia , 14 ( 35 % ) with upper respiratory tract infections , and 2 ( 5 % ) with bronchiolitis . cough ( 82.5 % ) , fever ( 75 % ) , and malaise ( 58.8 % ) were the most common symptoms , and crepitations ( 60 % ) , and wheezes ( 40 % ) were the most common signs . most patients with pneumonia had crepitations ( 79.2 % ) but only 25 % had bronchial breathing . immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia ( 8/9 versus 16/31 , p = 0.05 ) . of the 24 patients with pneumonia , 14 ( 58.3 % ) had uneventful recovery , 4 ( 16.7 % ) recovered following some complications , 3 ( 12.5 % ) died because of m pneumoniae infection , and 3 ( 12.5 % ) died due to underlying comorbidities . the 3 patients who died of m pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities . conclusion : our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high ."
nitric oxide : a pro-inflammatory mediator in lung disease ?,"inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract are commonly associated with elevated production of nitric oxide ( no • ) and increased indices of no • - dependent oxidative stress . although no • is known to have anti-microbial , anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties , various lines of evidence support the contribution of no • to lung injury in several disease models . on the basis of biochemical evidence , it is often presumed that such no • - dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite , although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte - derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation . because of the overwhelming literature on no • generation and activities in the respiratory tract , it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively . instead , it focuses on recent evidence and concepts of the presumed contribution of no • to inflammatory diseases of the lung ."
surfactant protein - d and pulmonary host defense .,"surfactant protein - d ( sp - d ) participates in the innate response to inhaled microorganisms and organic antigens , and contributes to immune and inflammatory regulation within the lung . sp - d is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells , but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts . sp - d , a collagenous calcium - dependent lectin ( or collectin ) , binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms , and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens . sp - d also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages , neutrophils , and lymphocytes . in addition , sp - d binds to specific surfactant - associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro . consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that sp - d - deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids , and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides . the phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of sp - d - deficient mice is altered , and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and / or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema . the expression of sp - d is increased in response to many forms of lung injury , and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized sp - d might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases ."
role of endothelin - 1 in lung disease .,"endothelin - 1 ( et - 1 ) is a 21 amino acid peptide with diverse biological activity that has been implicated in numerous diseases . et - 1 is a potent mitogen regulator of smooth muscle tone , and inflammatory mediator that may play a key role in diseases of the airways , pulmonary circulation , and inflammatory lung diseases , both acute and chronic . this review will focus on the biology of et - 1 and its role in lung disease ."
gene expression in epithelial cells in response to pneumovirus infection .,"respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) and pneumonia virus of mice ( pvm ) are viruses of the family paramyxoviridae , subfamily pneumovirus , which cause clinically important respiratory infections in humans and rodents , respectively . the respiratory epithelial target cells respond to viral infection with specific alterations in gene expression , including production of chemoattractant cytokines , adhesion molecules , elements that are related to the apoptosis response , and others that remain incompletely understood . here we review our current understanding of these mucosal responses and discuss several genomic approaches , including differential display reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and gene array strategies , that will permit us to unravel the nature of these responses in a more complete and systematic manner ."
sequence requirements for rna strand transfer during nidovirus discontinuous subgenomic rna synthesis .,"nidovirus subgenomic mrnas contain a leader sequence derived from the 5 ′ end of the genome fused to different sequences ( ‘ bodies ’ ) derived from the 3 ′ end . their generation involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous subgenomic rna synthesis that resembles copy - choice rna recombination . during this process , the nascent rna strand is transferred from one site in the template to another , during either plus or minus strand synthesis , to yield subgenomic rna molecules . central to this process are transcription - regulating sequences ( trss ) , which are present at both template sites and ensure the fidelity of strand transfer . here we present results of a comprehensive co-variation mutagenesis study of equine arteritis virus trss , demonstrating that discontinuous rna synthesis depends not only on base pairing between sense leader trs and antisense body trs , but also on the primary sequence of the body trs . while the leader trs merely plays a targeting role for strand transfer , the body trs fulfils multiple functions . the sequences of mrna leader – body junctions of trs mutants strongly suggested that the discontinuous step occurs during minus strand synthesis ."
debate : transfusing to normal haemoglobin levels will not improve outcome .,"recent evidence suggests that critically ill patients are able to tolerate lower levels of haemoglobin than was previously believed . it is our goal to show that transfusing to a level of 100 g / l does not improve mortality and other clinically important outcomes in a critical care setting . although many questions remain , many laboratory and clinical studies , including a recent randomized controlled trial ( rct ) , have established that transfusing to normal haemoglobin concentrations does not improve organ failure and mortality in the critically ill patient . in addition , a restrictive transfusion strategy will reduce exposure to allogeneic transfusions , result in more efficient use of red blood cells ( rbcs ) , save blood overall , and decrease health care costs ."
"the 21st international symposium on intensive care and emergency medicine , brussels , belgium , 20 - 23 march 2001 .","the 21st international symposium on intensive care and emergency medicine was dominated by the results of recent clinical trials in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) . the promise of extracorporeal liver replacement therapy and noninvasive ventilation were other areas of interest . ethical issues also received attention . overall , the ' state of the art ' lectures , pro / con debates , seminars and tutorials were of a high standard . the meeting was marked by a sense of renewed enthusiasm that positive progress is occurring in intensive care medicine ."
heme oxygenase - 1 and carbon monoxide in pulmonary medicine .,"heme oxygenase - 1 ( ho - 1 ) , an inducible stress protein , confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo . in addition to its physiological role in heme degradation , ho - 1 may influence a number of cellular processes , including growth , inflammation , and apoptosis . by virtue of anti-inflammatory effects , ho - 1 limits tissue damage in response to proinflammatory stimuli and prevents allograft rejection after transplantation . the transcriptional upregulation of ho - 1 responds to many agents , such as hypoxia , bacterial lipopolysaccharide , and reactive oxygen / nitrogen species . ho - 1 and its constitutively expressed isozyme , heme oxygenase - 2 , catalyze the rate - limiting step in the conversion of heme to its metabolites , bilirubin ixα , ferrous iron , and carbon monoxide ( co ) . the mechanisms by which ho - 1 provides protection most likely involve its enzymatic reaction products . remarkably , administration of co at low concentrations can substitute for ho - 1 with respect to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects , suggesting a role for co as a key mediator of ho - 1 function . chronic , low - level , exogenous exposure to co from cigarette smoking contributes to the importance of co in pulmonary medicine . the implications of the ho - 1 / co system in pulmonary diseases will be discussed in this review , with an emphasis on inflammatory states ."
technical description of rods : a real - time public health surveillance system .,"this report describes the design and implementation of the real - time outbreak and disease surveillance ( rods ) system , a computer - based public health surveillance system for early detection of disease outbreaks . hospitals send rods data from clinical encounters over virtual private networks and leased lines using the health level 7 ( hl7 ) message protocol . the data are sent in real time . rods automatically classifies the registration chief complaint from the visit into one of seven syndrome categories using bayesian classifiers . it stores the data in a relational database , aggregates the data for analysis using data warehousing techniques , applies univariate and multivariate statistical detection algorithms to the data , and alerts users of when the algorithms identify anomalous patterns in the syndrome counts . rods also has a web - based user interface that supports temporal and spatial analyses . rods processes sales of over-the-counter health care products in a similar manner but receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis . rods was used during the 2002 winter olympics and currently operates in two states — pennsylvania and utah . it has been and continues to be a resource for implementing , evaluating , and applying new methods of public health surveillance ."
conservation of polyamine regulation by translational frameshifting from yeast to mammals .,"regulation of ornithine decarboxylase in vertebrates involves a negative feedback mechanism requiring the protein antizyme . here we show that a similar mechanism exists in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe . the expression of mammalian antizyme genes requires a specific +1 translational frameshift . the efficiency of the frameshift event reflects cellular polyamine levels creating the autoregulatory feedback loop . as shown here , the yeast antizyme gene and several newly identified antizyme genes from different nematodes also require a ribosomal frameshift event for their expression . twelve nucleotides around the frameshift site are identical between s.pombe and the mammalian counterparts . the core element for this frameshifting is likely to have been present in the last common ancestor of yeast , nematodes and mammals ."
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a1 regulates rna synthesis of a cytoplasmic virus .,"heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein ( hnrnp a1 ) is involved in pre-mrna splicing in the nucleus and translational regulation in the cytoplasm . in the present study , we demonstrate that hnrnp a1 also participates in the transcription and replication of a cytoplasmic rna virus , mouse hepatitis virus ( mhv ) . overexpression of hnrnp a1 accelerated the kinetics of viral rna synthesis , whereas the expression in the cytoplasm of a dominant - negative hnrnp a1 mutant that lacks the nuclear transport domain significantly delayed it . the hnrnp a1 mutant caused a global inhibition of viral mrna transcription and genomic replication , and also a preferential inhibition of the replication of defective - interfering rnas . similar to the wild - type hnrnp a1 , the hnrnp a1 mutant complexed with an mhv polymerase gene product , the nucleocapsid protein and the viral rna . however , in contrast to the wild - type hnrnp a1 , the mutant protein failed to bind a 250 kda cellular protein , suggesting that the recruitment of cellular proteins by hnrnp a1 is important for mhv rna synthesis . our findings establish the importance of cellular factors in viral rna - dependent rna synthesis ."
a method to identify p62 's uba domain interacting proteins .,"the uba domain is a conserved sequence motif among polyubiquitin binding proteins . for the first time , we demonstrate a systematic , high throughput approach to identification of uba domain - interacting proteins from a proteome - wide perspective . using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro expression cloning system , we have successfully identified eleven proteins that interact with p62 ’s uba domain , and the majority of the eleven proteins are associated with neurodegenerative disorders , such as alzheimer ’s disease . therefore , p62 may play a novel regulatory role through its uba domain . our approach provides an easy route to the characterization of uba domain interacting proteins and its application will unfold the important roles that the uba domain plays ."
vaccinia virus infection disrupts microtubule organization and centrosome function .,"we examined the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton during vaccinia virus infection . we found that newly assembled virus particles accumulate in the vicinity of the microtubule - organizing centre in a microtubule - and dynein – dynactin complex - dependent fashion . microtubules are required for efficient intracellular mature virus ( imv ) formation and are essential for intracellular enveloped virus ( iev ) assembly . as infection proceeds , the microtubule cytoskeleton becomes dramatically reorganized in a fashion reminiscent of overexpression of microtubule - associated proteins ( maps ) . consistent with this , we report that the vaccinia proteins a10l and l4r have map - like properties and mediate direct binding of viral cores to microtubules in vitro . in addition , vaccinia infection also results in severe reduction of proteins at the centrosome and loss of centrosomal microtubule nucleation efficiency . this represents the first example of viral - induced disruption of centrosome function . further studies with vaccinia will provide insights into the role of microtubules during viral pathogenesis and regulation of centrosome function ."
"multi-faceted , multi-versatile microarray : simultaneous detection of many viruses and their expression profiles .","there are hundreds of viruses that infect different human organs and cause diseases . some fatal emerging viral infections have become serious public health issues worldwide . early diagnosis and subsequent treatment are therefore essential for fighting viral infections . current diagnostic techniques frequently employ polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) - based methods to quickly detect the pathogenic viruses and establish the etiology of the disease or illness . however , the fast pcr method suffers from many drawbacks such as a high false - positive rate and the ability to detect only one or a few gene targets at a time . microarray technology solves the problems of the pcr limitations and can be effectively applied to all fields of molecular medicine . recently , a report in retrovirology described a multi-virus dna array that contains more than 250 open reading frames from eight human viruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 . this array can be used to detect multiple viral co-infections in cells and in vivo . another benefit of this kind of multi-virus array is in studying promoter activity and viral gene expression and correlating such readouts with the progression of disease and reactivation of latent infections . thus , the virus dna - chip development reported in retrovirology is an important advance in diagnostic application which could be a potent clinical tool for characterizing viral co-infections in aids as well as other patients ."
herpes simplex virus type 1 and normal protein permeability in the lungs of critically ill patients : a case for low pathogenicity ?,"introduction : the pathogenicity of late respiratory infections with herpes simplex virus type 1 ( hsv - 1 ) in the critically ill is unclear . methods : in four critically ill patients with persistent pulmonary infiltrates of unknown origin and isolation of hsv - 1 from tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid , at 7 ( 1 – 11 ) days after start of mechanical ventilatory support , a pulmonary leak index ( pli ) for ( 67 ) gallium ( ( 67 ) ga ) - transferrin ( upper limit of normal 14.1 × 10 ( - 3 ) / min ) was measured . results : the pli ranged between 7.5 and 14.0 × 10 ( - 3 ) / min in the study patients . two patients received a course of acyclovir and all survived . conclusions : the normal capillary permeability observed in the lungs argues against pathogenicity of hsv - 1 in the critically ill , and favors that isolation of the virus reflects reactivation in the course of serious illness and immunodepresssion , rather than primary or superimposed infection in the lungs ."
logistics of community smallpox control through contact tracing and ring vaccination : a stochastic network model .,"background : previous smallpox ring vaccination models based on contact tracing over a network suggest that ring vaccination would be effective , but have not explicitly included response logistics and limited numbers of vaccinators . methods : we developed a continuous - time stochastic simulation of smallpox transmission , including network structure , post-exposure vaccination , vaccination of contacts of contacts , limited response capacity , heterogeneity in symptoms and infectiousness , vaccination prior to the discontinuation of routine vaccination , more rapid diagnosis due to public awareness , surveillance of asymptomatic contacts , and isolation of cases . results : we found that even in cases of very rapidly spreading smallpox , ring vaccination ( when coupled with surveillance ) is sufficient in most cases to eliminate smallpox quickly , assuming that 95 % of household contacts are traced , 80 % of workplace or social contacts are traced , and no casual contacts are traced , and that in most cases the ability to trace 1 – 5 individuals per day per index case is sufficient . if smallpox is assumed to be transmitted very quickly to contacts , it may at times escape containment by ring vaccination , but could be controlled in these circumstances by mass vaccination . conclusions : small introductions of smallpox are likely to be easily contained by ring vaccination , provided contact tracing is feasible . uncertainties in the nature of bioterrorist smallpox ( infectiousness , vaccine efficacy ) support continued planning for ring vaccination as well as mass vaccination . if initiated , ring vaccination should be conducted without delays in vaccination , should include contacts of contacts ( whenever there is sufficient capacity ) and should be accompanied by increased public awareness and surveillance ."
protection of pulmonary epithelial cells from oxidative stress by hmyh adenine glycosylase .,"background : oxygen toxicity is a major cause of lung injury . the base excision repair pathway is one of the most important cellular protection mechanisms that responds to oxidative dna damage . lesion - specific dna repair enzymes include hogg1 , hmyh , hnth and hmth . methods : the above lesion - specific dna repair enzymes were expressed in human alveolar epithelial cells ( a549 ) using the psf91 .1 retroviral vector . cells were exposed to a 95 % oxygen environment , ionizing radiation ( ir ) , or h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ) . cell growth analysis was performed under non-toxic conditions . western blot analysis was performed to verify over-expression and assess endogenous expression under toxic and non-toxic conditions . statistical analysis was performed using the paired student 's t test with significance being accepted for p < 0.05 . results : cell killing assays demonstrated cells over-expressing hmyh had improved survival to both increased oxygen and ir . cell growth analysis of a549 cells under non-toxic conditions revealed cells over-expressing hmyh also grow at a slower rate . western blot analysis demonstrated over-expression of each individual gene and did not result in altered endogenous expression of the others . however , it was observed that o ( 2 ) toxicity did lead to a reduced endogenous expression of hnth in a549 cells . conclusion : increased expression of the dna glycosylase repair enzyme hmyh in a549 cells exposed to o ( 2 ) and ir leads to improvements in cell survival . dna repair through the base excision repair pathway may provide an alternative way to offset the damaging effects of o ( 2 ) and its metabolites ."
bioinformatic mapping of alkb homology domains in viruses .,"background : alkb - like proteins are members of the 2 - oxoglutarate - and fe ( ii ) - dependent oxygenase superfamily . in escherichia coli the protein protects rna and dna against damage from methylating agents . 1 - methyladenine and 3 - methylcytosine are repaired by oxidative demethylation and direct reversal of the methylated base back to its unmethylated form . genes for alkb homologues are widespread in nature , and eukaryotes often have several genes coding for alkb - like proteins . similar domains have also been observed in certain plant viruses . the function of the viral domain is unknown , but it has been suggested that it may be involved in protecting the virus against the post-transcriptional gene silencing ( ptgs ) system found in plants . we wanted to do a phylogenomic mapping of viral alkb - like domains as a basis for analysing functional aspects of these domains , because this could have some relevance for understanding possible alternative roles of alkb homologues e.g. in eukaryotes . results : profile - based searches of protein sequence libraries showed that alkb - like domains are found in at least 22 different single - stranded rna positive - strand plant viruses , but mainly in a subgroup of the flexiviridae family . sequence analysis indicated that the alkb domains probably are functionally conserved , and that they most likely have been integrated relatively recently into several viral genomes at geographically distinct locations . this pattern seems to be more consistent with increased environmental pressure , e.g. from methylating pesticides , than with interaction with the ptgs system . conclusions : the alkb domain found in viral genomes is most likely a conventional dna / rna repair domain that protects the viral rna genome against methylating compounds from the environment ."
managing emerging infectious diseases : is a federal system an impediment to effective laws ?,"in the 1980 's and 1990 's hiv / aids was the emerging infectious disease . in 2003 – 2004 we saw the emergence of sars , avian influenza and anthrax in a man made form used for bioterrorism . emergency powers legislation in australia is a patchwork of commonwealth quarantine laws and state and territory based emergency powers in public health legislation . it is time for a review of such legislation and time for consideration of the efficacy of such legislation from a country wide perspective in an age when we have to consider the possibility of mass outbreaks of communicable diseases which ignore jurisdictional boundaries ."
protein secretion in lactococcus lactis : an efficient way to increase the overall heterologous protein production .,"lactococcus lactis , the model lactic acid bacterium ( lab ) , is a food grade and well - characterized gram positive bacterium . it is a good candidate for heterologous protein delivery in foodstuff or in the digestive tract . l. lactis can also be used as a protein producer in fermentor . many heterologous proteins have already been produced in l. lactis but only few reports allow comparing production yields for a given protein either produced intracellularly or secreted in the medium . here , we review several works evaluating the influence of the localization on the production yields of several heterologous proteins produced in l. lactis . the questions of size limits , conformation , and proteolysis are addressed and discussed with regard to protein yields . these data show that i ) secretion is preferable to cytoplasmic production ; ii ) secretion enhancement ( by signal peptide and propeptide optimization ) results in increased production yield ; iii ) protein conformation rather than protein size can impair secretion and thus alter production yields ; and iv ) fusion of a stable protein can stabilize labile proteins . the role of intracellular proteolysis on heterologous cytoplasmic proteins and precursors is discussed . the new challenges now are the development of food grade systems and the identification and optimization of host factors affecting heterologous protein production not only in l. lactis , but also in other lab species ."
detection and characterization of horizontal transfers in prokaryotes using genomic signature .,"horizontal dna transfer is an important factor of evolution and participates in biological diversity . unfortunately , the location and length of horizontal transfers ( hts ) are known for very few species . the usage of short oligonucleotides in a sequence ( the so - called genomic signature ) has been shown to be species - specific even in dna fragments as short as 1 kb . the genomic signature is therefore proposed as a tool to detect hts . since dna transfers originate from species with a signature different from those of the recipient species , the analysis of local variations of signature along recipient genome may allow for detecting exogenous dna . the strategy consists in ( i ) scanning the genome with a sliding window , and calculating the corresponding local signature ( ii ) evaluating its deviation from the signature of the whole genome and ( iii ) looking for similar signatures in a database of genomic signatures . a total of 22 prokaryote genomes are analyzed in this way . it has been observed that atypical regions make up ∼ 6 % of each genome on the average . most of the claimed hts as well as new ones are detected . the origin of putative dna transfers is looked for among ∼ 12 000 species . donor species are proposed and sometimes strongly suggested , considering similarity of signatures . among the species studied , bacillus subtilis , haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli are investigated by many authors and give the opportunity to perform a thorough comparison of most of the bioinformatics methods used to detect hts ."
"comparisons of substitution , insertion and deletion probes for resequencing and mutational analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays .","although oligonucleotide probes complementary to single nucleotide substitutions are commonly used in microarray - based screens for genetic variation , little is known about the hybridization properties of probes complementary to small insertions and deletions . it is necessary to define the hybridization properties of these latter probes in order to improve the specificity and sensitivity of oligonucleotide microarray - based mutational analysis of disease - related genes . here , we compare and contrast the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide microarrays consisting of 25mer probes complementary to all possible single nucleotide substitutions and insertions , and one and two base deletions in the 9168 bp coding region of the atm ( ataxia telangiectasia mutated ) gene . over 68 different dye - labeled single - stranded nucleic acid targets representing all atm coding exons were applied to these microarrays . we assess hybridization specificity by comparing the relative hybridization signals from probes perfectly matched to atm sequences to those containing mismatches . probes complementary to two base substitutions displayed the highest average specificity followed by those complementary to single base substitutions , single base deletions and single base insertions . in all the cases , hybridization specificity was strongly influenced by sequence context and possible intra - and intermolecular probe and / or target structure . furthermore , single nucleotide substitution probes displayed the most consistent hybridization specificity data followed by single base deletions , two base deletions and single nucleotide insertions . overall , these studies provide valuable empirical data that can be used to more accurately model the hybridization properties of insertion and deletion probes and improve the design and interpretation of oligonucleotide microarray - based resequencing and mutational analysis ."
a gene encoding sialic - acid - specific 9 - o - acetylesterase found in human adult testis .,"using differential display rt - pcr , we identified a gene of 2750 bp from human adult testis , named h - lse , which encoded a putative protein of 523 amino acids and molecular weight of 58 kd with structural characteristics similar to that of mouse lysosome sialic - acid - specific 9 - o - acetylesterase . northern blot analysis showed a widespread distribution of h - lse in various human tissues with high expression in the testis , prostate , and colon . in situ hybridization results showed that while h - lse was not detected in embryonic testis , positive signals were found in spermatocytes but not spermatogonia in adult testis of human . the subcellular localization of h - lse was visualized by green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) fused to the amino terminus of h - lse , showing compartmentalization of h - lse in large dense - core vesicles , presumably lysosomes , in the cytoplasm . the developmentally regulated and spermatogenic stage - specific expression of h - lse suggests its possible involvement in the development of the testis and / or differentiation of germ cells ."
the role of mast cells in the pathogenesis of pain in chronic pancreatitis .,background : the biological basis of pain in chronic pancreatitis is poorly understood . mast cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pain in other conditions . we hypothesized that mast cells play a role in the pain of chronic pancreatitis . we examined the association of pain with mast cells in autopsy specimens of patients with painful chronic pancreatitis . we explored our hypothesis further using an experimental model of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ( tnbs ) - induced chronic pancreatitis in both wild type ( wt ) and mast cell deficient mice ( mcdm ) . methods : archival tissues with histological diagnoses of chronic pancreatitis were identified and clinical records reviewed for presence or absence of reported pain in humans . mast cells were counted . the presence of pain was assessed using von frey filaments ( vff ) to measure abdominal withdrawal responses in both wt and mcdm mice with and without chronic pancreatitis . results : humans with painful chronic pancreatitis demonstrated a 3.5-fold increase in pancreatic mast cells as compared with those with painless chronic pancreatitis . wt mice with chronic pancreatitis were significantly more sensitive as assessed by vff pain testing of the abdomen when compared with mcdm . conclusion : humans with painful chronic pancreatitis have an increased number of pancreatic mast cells as compared with those with painless chronic pancreatitis . mcdm are less sensitive to mechanical stimulation of the abdomen after induction of chronic pancreatitis as compared with wt . mast cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pain in chronic pancreatitis .
recombination every day : abundant recombination in a virus during a single multi-cellular host infection .,"viral recombination can dramatically impact evolution and epidemiology . in viruses , the recombination rate depends on the frequency of genetic exchange between different viral genomes within an infected host cell and on the frequency at which such co-infections occur . while the recombination rate has been recently evaluated in experimentally co-infected cell cultures for several viruses , direct quantification at the most biologically significant level , that of a host infection , is still lacking . this study fills this gap using the cauliflower mosaic virus as a model . we distributed four neutral markers along the viral genome , and co-inoculated host plants with marker - containing and wild - type viruses . the frequency of recombinant genomes was evaluated 21 d post-inoculation . on average , over 50 % of viral genomes recovered after a single host infection were recombinants , clearly indicating that recombination is very frequent in this virus . estimates of the recombination rate show that all regions of the genome are equally affected by this process . assuming that ten viral replication cycles occurred during our experiment — based on data on the timing of coat protein detection — the per base and replication cycle recombination rate was on the order of 2 × 10 ( − 5 ) to 4 × 10 ( − 5 ) . this first determination of a virus recombination rate during a single multi-cellular host infection indicates that recombination is very frequent in the everyday life of this virus ."
torsional restraint : a new twist on frameshifting pseudoknots .,"mrna pseudoknots have a stimulatory function in programmed − 1 ribosomal frameshifting ( − 1 prf ) . though we previously presented a model for how mrna pseudoknots might activate the mechanism for − 1 prf , it did not address the question of the role that they may play in positioning the mrna relative to the ribosome in this process [ e. p. plant , k. l. m. jacobs , j. w. harger , a. meskauskas , j. l. jacobs , j. l. baxter , a. n. petrov and j. d. dinman ( 2003 ) rna , 9 , 168 – 174 ] . a separate ‘ torsional restraint ’ model suggests that mrna pseudoknots act to increase the fraction of ribosomes directed to pause with the upstream heptameric slippery site positioned at the ribosome 's a - and p - decoding sites [ j. d. dinman ( 1995 ) yeast , 11 , 1115 – 1127 ] . here , experiments using a series of ‘ pseudo-pseudoknots ’ having different degrees of rotational freedom were used to test this model . the results of this study support the mechanistic hypothesis that − 1 ribosomal frameshifting is enhanced by torsional resistance of the mrna pseudoknot ."
correcting errors in synthetic dna through consensus shuffling .,"although efficient methods exist to assemble synthetic oligonucleotides into genes and genomes , these suffer from the presence of 1 – 3 random errors / kb of dna . here , we introduce a new method termed consensus shuffling and demonstrate its use to significantly reduce random errors in synthetic dna . in this method , errors are revealed as mismatches by re-hybridization of the population . the dna is fragmented , and mismatched fragments are removed upon binding to an immobilized mismatch binding protein ( muts ) . pcr assembly of the remaining fragments yields a new population of full - length sequences enriched for the consensus sequence of the input population . we show that two iterations of consensus shuffling improved a population of synthetic green fluorescent protein ( gfpuv ) clones from ∼ 60 to > 90 % fluorescent , and decreased errors 3.5 - to 4.3-fold to final values of ∼ 1 error per 3500 bp . in addition , two iterations of consensus shuffling corrected a population of gfpuv clones where all members were non-functional , to a population where 82 % of clones were fluorescent . consensus shuffling should facilitate the rapid and accurate synthesis of long dna sequences ."
towards standardization of rna quality assessment using user - independent classifiers of microcapillary electrophoresis traces .,"while it is universally accepted that intact rna constitutes the best representation of the steady - state of transcription , there is no gold standard to define rna quality prior to gene expression analysis . in this report , we evaluated the reliability of conventional methods for rna quality assessment including uv spectroscopy and 28s : 18s area ratios , and demonstrated their inconsistency . we then used two new freely available classifiers , the degradometer and rin systems , to produce user - independent rna quality metrics , based on analysis of microcapillary electrophoresis traces . both provided highly informative and valuable data and the results were found highly correlated , while the rin system gave more reliable data . the relevance of the rna quality metrics for assessment of gene expression differences was tested by q - pcr , revealing a significant decline of the relative expression of genes in rna samples of disparate quality , while samples of similar , even poor integrity were found highly comparable . we discuss the consequences of these observations to minimize artifactual detection of false positive and negative differential expression due to rna integrity differences , and propose a scheme for the development of a standard operational procedure , with optional registration of rna integrity metrics in public repositories of gene expression data ."
factors affecting translation at the programmed − 1 ribosomal frameshifting site of cocksfoot mottle virus rna in vivo .,"the ratio between proteins p27 and replicase of cocksfoot mottle virus ( cfmv ) is regulated via a − 1 programmed ribosomal frameshift ( − 1 prf ) . a minimal frameshift signal with a slippery u uua aac heptamer and a downstream stem – loop structure was inserted into a dual reporter vector and directed − 1 prf with an efficiency of 14.4 ± 1.9 % in yeast and 2.4 ± 0.7 % in bacteria . p27 - encoding cfmv sequence flanking the minimal frameshift signal caused ∼ 2-fold increase in the − 1 prf efficiencies both in yeast and in bacteria . in addition to the expected fusion proteins , termination products ending putatively at the frameshift site were found in yeast cells . we propose that the amount of premature translation termination from control mrnas played a role in determining the calculated − 1prf efficiency . co-expression of cfmv p27 with the dual reporter vector containing the minimal frameshift signal reduced the production of the downstream reporter , whereas replicase co-expression had no pronounced effect . this finding allows us to propose that cfmv protein p27 may influence translation at the frameshift site but the mechanism needs to be elucidated ."
australian public health policy in 2003 – 2004 .,"in australia , compared with other developed countries the many and varied programs which comprise public health have continued to be funded poorly and unsystematically , particularly given the amount of publicly voiced political support . in 2003 , the major public health policy developments in communicable disease control were in the fields of sars , and vaccine funding , whilst the tga was focused on the pan pharmaceutical crisis . programs directed to health maintenance and healthy ageing were approved . the tertiary education sector was involved in the development of programs for training the public health workforce and new professional qualifications and competencies . the abelson report received support from overseas experts , providing a potential platform for calls to improve national funding for future australian preventive programs ; however , inconsistencies continued across all jurisdictions in their approaches to tackling national health priorities . despite 2004 being an election year , public health policy was not visible , with the bulk of the public health funding available in the 2004/05 federal budget allocated to managing such emerging risks as avian flu . we conclude by suggesting several implications for the future ."

globalization and health .,"this debut editorial of globalization and health introduces the journal , briefly delineating its goals and objectives and outlines its scope of subject matter . ' open access ' publishing is expected to become an increasingly important format for peer reviewed academic journals and that globalization and health is ' open access ' is appropriate . the rationale behind starting a journal dedicated to globalization and health is three fold : firstly : globalization is reshaping the social geography within which we might strive to create health or prevent disease . the determinants of health – be they a sars virus or a predilection for fatty foods – have joined us in our global mobility . driven by economic liberalization and changing technologies , the phenomenon of ' access ' is likely to dominate to an increasing extent the unfolding experience of human disease and wellbeing . secondly : understanding globalization as a subject matter itself needs certain benchmarks and barometers of its successes and failings . health is one such barometer . it is a marker of social infrastructure and social welfare and as such can be used to either sound an alarm or give a victory cheer as our interconnectedness hurts and heals the populations we serve . and lastly : in as much as globalization can have an effect on health , it is also true that health and disease has an effect on globalization as exemplified by the existence of quarantine laws and the devastating economic effects of the aids pandemic . a balanced view would propose that the effects of globalization on health ( and health systems ) are neither universally good nor bad , but rather context specific . if the dialogue pertaining to globalization is to be directed or biased in any direction , then it must be this : that we consider the poor first ."
the ' polysemous ' codon -- a codon with multiple amino acid assignment caused by dual specificity of trna identity .,"in some candida species , the universal cug leucine codon is translated as serine . however , in most cases , the serine trnas responsible for this non-universal decoding ( trna ( ser ) cag ) accept in vitro not only serine , but also , to some extent , leucine . nucleotide replacement experiments indicated that m1g37 is critical for leucylation activity . this finding was supported by the fact that the trna ( ser ) cags possessing the leucylation activity always have m1g37 , whereas that of candida cylindracea , which possesses no leucylation activity , has a37 . quantification of defined aminoacetylated trnas in cells demonstrated that 3 % of the trna ( ser ) cags possessing m1g37 were , in fact , charged with leucine in vivo . a genetic approach using an auxotroph mutant of c.maltosa possessing this type of trna ( ser ) cag also suggested that the ura3 gene inactivated due to the translation of cug as serine was rescued by a slight incorporation of leucine into the polypeptide , which demonstrated that the trna charged with multiple amino acids could participate in the translation . these findings provide the first evidence that two distinct amino acids are assigned by a single codon , which occurs naturally in the translation process of certain candida species . we term this novel type of codon a ' polysemous codon ' ."
a universal bmv - based rna recombination system — how to search for general rules in rna recombination .,"at present , there is no doubt that rna recombination is one of the major factors responsible for the generation of new rna viruses and retroviruses . numerous experimental systems have been created to investigate this complex phenomenon . consequently , specific rna structural motifs mediating recombination have been identified in several viruses . unfortunately , up till now a unified model of genetic rna recombination has not been formulated , mainly due to difficulties with the direct comparison of data obtained for different rna - based viruses . to solve this problem , we have attempted to construct a universal system in which the recombination activity of various rna sequences could be tested . to this end , we have used brome mosaic virus , a model ( + ) rna virus of plants , for which the structural requirements of rna recombination are well defined . the effectiveness of the new homomolecular system has been proven in an experiment involving two rna sequences derived from the hepatitis c virus genome . in addition , comparison of the data obtained with the homomolecular system with those generated earlier using the heteromolecular one has provided new evidence that the mechanisms of homologous and non-homologous recombination are different and depend on the virus ' mode of replication ."
"neutrophil elastase , an acid - independent serine protease , facilitates reovirus uncoating and infection in u937 promonocyte cells .","background : mammalian reoviruses naturally infect their hosts through the enteric and respiratory tracts . during enteric infections , proteolysis of the reovirus outer capsid protein σ3 is mediated by pancreatic serine proteases . in contrast , the proteases critical for reovirus replication in the lung are unknown . neutrophil elastase ( ne ) is an acid - independent , inflammatory serine protease predominantly expressed by neutrophils . in addition to its normal role in microbial defense , aberrant expression of ne has been implicated in the pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) . because reovirus replication in rodent lungs causes ards - like symptoms and induces an infiltration of neutrophils , we investigated the capacity of ne to promote reovirus virion uncoating . results : the human promonocyte cell line u937 expresses ne . treatment of u937 cells with the broad - spectrum cysteine - protease inhibitor e64 [ trans - epoxysuccinyl - l - leucylamido - ( 4 - guanidino ) butane ] and with agents that increase vesicular ph did not inhibit reovirus replication . even when these inhibitors were used in combination , reovirus replicated to significant yields , indicating that an acid - independent non-cysteine protease was capable of mediating reovirus uncoating in u937 cell cultures . to identify the protease ( s ) responsible , u937 cells were treated with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( pma ) , an agent that induces cellular differentiation and results in decreased expression of acid - independent serine proteases , including ne and cathepsin ( cat ) g . in the presence of e64 , reovirus did not replicate efficiently in pma - treated cells . to directly assess the role of ne in reovirus infection of u937 cells , we examined viral growth in the presence of n - ala - ala - pro-val chloromethylketone , a ne - specific inhibitor . reovirus replication in the presence of e64 was significantly reduced by treatment of cells with the ne inhibitor . incubation of virions with purified ne resulted in the generation of infectious subviron particles that did not require additional intracellular proteolysis . conclusion : our findings reveal that ne can facilitate reovirus infection . the fact that it does so in the presence of agents that raise vesicular ph supports a model in which the requirement for acidic ph during infection reflects the conditions required for optimal protease activity . the capacity of reovirus to exploit ne may impact viral replication in the lung and other tissues during natural infections ."
the influence of locked nucleic acid residues on the thermodynamic properties of 2 ′ - o - methyl rna / rna heteroduplexes .,"the influence of locked nucleic acid ( lna ) residues on the thermodynamic properties of 2 ′ - o - methyl rna / rna heteroduplexes is reported . optical melting studies indicate that lna incorporated into an otherwise 2 ′ - o - methyl rna oligonucleotide usually , but not always , enhances the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with rna . several trends are apparent , including : ( i ) a 3 ′ terminal u lna and 5 ′ terminal lnas are less stabilizing than interior and other 3 ′ terminal lnas ; ( ii ) most of the stability enhancement is achieved when lna nucleotides are separated by at least one 2 ′ - o - methyl nucleotide ; and ( iii ) the effects of lna substitutions are approximately additive when the lna nucleotides are separated by at least one 2 ′ - o - methyl nucleotide . an equation is proposed to approximate the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with rna when at least one 2 ′ - o - methyl nucleotide separates lna nucleotides . the sequence dependence of 2 ′ - o - methyl rna / rna duplexes appears to be similar to that of rna / rna duplexes , and preliminary nearest - neighbor free energy increments at 37 °c are presented for 2 ′ - o - methyl rna / rna duplexes . internal mismatches with lna nucleotides significantly destabilize duplexes with rna ."
draft versus finished sequence data for dna and protein diagnostic signature development .,"sequencing pathogen genomes is costly , demanding careful allocation of limited sequencing resources . we built a computational sequencing analysis pipeline ( sap ) to guide decisions regarding the amount of genomic sequencing necessary to develop high - quality diagnostic dna and protein signatures . sap uses simulations to estimate the number of target genomes and close phylogenetic relatives ( near neighbors or nns ) to sequence . we use sap to assess whether draft data are sufficient or finished sequencing is required using marburg and variola virus sequences . simulations indicate that intermediate to high - quality draft with error rates of 10 ( − 3 ) – 10 ( − 5 ) ( ∼ 8 × coverage ) of target organisms is suitable for dna signature prediction . low - quality draft with error rates of ∼ 1 % ( 3 × to 6 × coverage ) of target isolates is inadequate for dna signature prediction , although low - quality draft of nns is sufficient , as long as the target genomes are of high quality . for protein signature prediction , sequencing errors in target genomes substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation , even if the draft is of high quality . in summary , high - quality draft of target and low - quality draft of nns appears to be a cost - effective investment for dna signature prediction , but may lead to underestimation of predicted protein signatures ."
an ontology for immune epitopes : application to the design of a broad scope database of immune reactivities .,"background : epitopes can be defined as the molecular structures bound by specific receptors , which are recognized during immune responses . the immune epitope database and analysis resource ( iedb ) project will catalog and organize information regarding antibody and t cell epitopes from infectious pathogens , experimental antigens and self - antigens , with a priority on niaid category a-c pathogens ( ) and emerging / re-emerging infectious diseases . both intrinsic structural and phylogenetic features , as well as information relating to the interactions of the epitopes with the host 's immune system will be catalogued . description : to effectively represent and communicate the information related to immune epitopes , a formal ontology was developed . the semantics of the epitope domain and related concepts were captured as a hierarchy of classes , which represent the general and specialized relationships between the various concepts . a complete listing of classes and their properties can be found at . conclusion : the iedb 's ontology is the first ontology specifically designed to capture both intrinsic chemical and biochemical information relating to immune epitopes with information relating to the interaction of these structures with molecules derived from the host immune system . we anticipate that the development of this type of ontology and associated databases will facilitate rigorous description of data related to immune epitopes , and might ultimately lead to completely new methods for describing and modeling immune responses ."
evaluation of potential reference genes in real - time rt - pcr studies of atlantic salmon .,"background : salmonid fishes are among the most widely studied model fish species but reports on systematic evaluation of reference genes in qrt - pcr studies is lacking . results : the stability of six potential reference genes was examined in eight tissues of atlantic salmon ( salmo salar ) , to determine the most suitable genes to be used in quantitative real - time rt - pcr analyses . the relative transcription levels of genes encoding 18s rrna , s20 ribosomal protein , β - actin , glyceraldehyde - 3p - dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) , and two paralog genes encoding elongation factor 1a ( ef1a ( a ) and ef1a ( b ) ) were quantified in gills , liver , head kidney , spleen , thymus , brain , muscle , and posterior intestine in six untreated adult fish , in addition to a group of individuals that went through smoltification . based on calculations performed with the genorm vba applet , which determines the most stable genes from a set of tested genes in a given cdna sample , the ranking of the examined genes in adult atlantic salmon was ef1a ( b ) > ef1a ( a ) > β - actin > 18s rrna > s20 > gapdh . when the same calculations were done on a total of 24 individuals from four stages in the smoltification process ( presmolt , smolt , smoltified seawater and desmoltified freshwater ) , the gene ranking was ef1a ( b ) > ef1a ( a ) > s20 > β - actin > 18s rrna > gapdh . conclusion : overall , this work suggests that the ef1a ( a ) and ef1a ( b ) genes can be useful as reference genes in qrt - pcr examination of gene expression in the atlantic salmon ."
relevance of human metapneumovirus in exacerbations of copd .,"background and methods : human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) is a recently discovered respiratory virus associated with bronchiolitis , pneumonia , croup and exacerbations of asthma . since respiratory viruses are frequently detected in patients with acute exacerbations of copd ( ae - copd ) it was our aim to investigate the frequency of hmpv detection in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with ae - copd compared to patients with stable copd and to smokers without by means of quantitative real - time rt - pcr . results : we analysed nasal lavage and induced sputum of 130 patients with ae - copd , 65 patients with stable copd and 34 smokers without copd . hmpv was detected in 3/130 ( 2.3 % ) ae - copd patients with a mean of 6.5 × 10 ( 5 ) viral copies / ml in nasal lavage and 1.88 × 10 ( 5 ) viral copies / ml in induced sputum . it was not found in patients with stable copd or smokers without copd . conclusion : hmpv is only found in a very small number of patients with ae - copd . however it should be considered as a further possible viral trigger of ae - copd because asymptomatic carriage is unlikely ."

public awareness of risk factors for cancer among the japanese general population : a population - based survey .,"background : the present study aimed to provide information on awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the japanese general population . methods : a nationwide representative sample of 2,000 japanese aged 20 or older was asked about their perception and level of concern about various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention , as a part of an omnibus survey . interviews were conducted with 1,355 subjects ( 609 men and 746 women ) . results : among 12 risk factor candidates , the attributable fraction of cancer - causing viral and bacterial infection was considered highest ( 51 % ) , followed by that of tobacco smoking ( 43 % ) , stress ( 39 % ) , and endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( 37 % ) . on the other hand , the attributable fractions of cancer by charred fish and meat ( 21 % ) and alcohol drinking ( 22 % ) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates . for most risk factors , attributable fraction responses were higher in women than in men . as a whole , the subjects tended to respond with higher values than those estimated by epidemiologic evidence in the west . the attributable fraction of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32 % , while 36 % of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle . conclusion : our results suggest that awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes in the japanese general population tends to be dominated by cancer - causing infection , occupational exposure , air pollution and food additives rather than major lifestyle factors such as diet ."
sequence specific visual detection of lamp reactions by addition of cationic polymers .,"background : development of a practical gene point - of - care testing device ( g - poct device ) requires innovative detection methods for demonstrating the results of the gene amplification reaction without the use of expensive equipment . we have studied a new method for the sequence - specific visual detection of minute amounts of nucleic acids using precipitation reaction by addition of cationic polymers to amplicons of loop mediated isothermal amplification ( lamp ) . results : oligo dna probes labeled with different fluorescent dyes were prepared for multiple nucleic acid templates , and the templates were amplified by the lamp reactions under the existence of the probes . at completion of the lamp reaction , an optimal amount of low molecular weight polyethylenimine ( pei ) was added , resulting in the precipitation of the insoluble lamp amplicon - pei complex . the fluorescently labeled oligo dna probes hybridized to the lamp product were incorporated into the precipitation , and the precipitate emitted fluorescence corresponding to the amplified nucleic acid templates . the color of emitted fluorescence can be detected easily by naked eye on a conventional uv illuminator . conclusion : the presence or absence of minute amount of nucleic acid templates could be detected in a simple manner through visual assessment for the color of the lamp amplicon - pei complex precipitate . we conclude that this detection method may facilitate development of small and simple g - poct device ."
"injection drug use and hiv / aids in china : review of current situation , prevention and policy implications .","illicit drug abuse and hiv / aids have increased rapidly in the past 10 to 20 years in china . this paper reviews drug abuse in china , the hiv / aids epidemic and its association with injection drug use ( idu ) , and chinese policies on illicit drug abuse and prevention of hiv / aids based on published literature and unpublished official data . as a major drug trans - shipment country with source drugs from the "" golden triangle "" and "" gold crescent "" areas in asia , china has also become an increasingly important drug consuming market . about half of china 's 1.14 million documented drug users inject , and many share needles . idu has contributed to 42 % of cumulatively reported hiv / aids cases thus far . drug trafficking is illegal in china and can lead to the death penalty . the public security departments adopt "" zero tolerance "" approach to drug use , which conflict with harm reduction policies of the public health departments . past experience in china suggests that cracking down on drug smuggling and prohibiting drug use alone can not prevent or solve all illicit drug related problems in the era of globalization . in recent years , the central government has outlined a series of pragmatic policies to encourage harm reduction programs ; meanwhile , some local governments have not fully mobilized to deal with drug abuse and hiv / aids problems seriously . strengthening government leadership at both central and local levels ; scaling up methadone substitution and needle exchange programs ; making hiv voluntary counseling and testing available and affordable to both urban and rural drug users ; and increasing utilization of outreach and nongovernmental organizations are offered as additional strategies to help cope with china 's hiv and drug abuse problem ."
development of a humanized monoclonal antibody with therapeutic potential against west nile virus .,"neutralization of west nile virus ( wnv ) in vivo correlates with the development of an antibody response against the viral envelope ( e ) protein . using random mutagenesis and yeast surface display , we defined individual contact residues of 14 newly generated monoclonal antibodies against domain iii of the wnv e protein . monoclonal antibodies that strongly neutralized wnv localized to a surface patch on the lateral face of domain iii . convalescent antibodies from individuals who had recovered from wnv infection also detected this epitope . one monoclonal antibody , e16 , neutralized 10 different strains in vitro , and showed therapeutic efficacy in mice , even when administered as a single dose 5 d after infection . a humanized version of e16 was generated that retained antigen specificity , avidity and neutralizing activity . in postexposure therapeutic trials in mice , a single dose of humanized e16 protected mice against wnv - induced mortality , and may therefore be a viable treatment option against wnv infection in humans . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10.1038 / nm1240 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users ."
local public health workers ' perceptions toward responding to an influenza pandemic .,"background : current national preparedness plans require local health departments to play an integral role in responding to an influenza pandemic , a major public health threat that the world health organization has described as "" inevitable and possibly imminent "" . to understand local public health workers ' perceptions toward pandemic influenza response , we surveyed 308 employees at three health departments in maryland from march – july 2005 , on factors that may influence their ability and willingness to report to duty in such an event . results : the data suggest that nearly half of the local health department workers are likely not to report to duty during a pandemic . the stated likelihood of reporting to duty was significantly greater for clinical ( multivariate or : 2.5 ; ci 1.3 – 4.7 ) than technical and support staff , and perception of the importance of one 's role in the agency 's overall response was the single most influential factor associated with willingness to report ( multivariate or : 9.5 ; ci 4.6 – 19.9 ) . conclusion : the perceived risk among public health workers was shown to be associated with several factors peripheral to the actual hazard of this event . these risk perception modifiers and the knowledge gaps identified serve as barriers to pandemic influenza response and must be specifically addressed to enable effective local public health response to this significant threat ."
on pandemics and the duty to care : whose duty ? who cares ?,"background : as a number of commentators have noted , sars exposed the vulnerabilities of our health care systems and governance structures . health care professionals ( hcps ) and hospital systems that bore the brunt of the sars outbreak continue to struggle with the aftermath of the crisis . indeed , hcps – both in clinical care and in public health – were severely tested by sars . unprecedented demands were placed on their skills and expertise , and their personal commitment to their profession was severely tried . many were exposed to serious risk of morbidity and mortality , as evidenced by the world health organization figures showing that approximately 30 % of reported cases were among hcps , some of whom died from the infection . despite this challenge , professional codes of ethics are silent on the issue of duty to care during communicable disease outbreaks , thus providing no guidance on what is expected of hcps or how they ought to approach their duty to care in the face of risk . discussion : in the aftermath of sars and with the spectre of a pandemic avian influenza , it is imperative that we ( re ) consider the obligations of hcps for patients with severe infectious diseases , particularly diseases that pose risks to those providing care . it is of pressing importance that organizations representing hcps give clear indication of what standard of care is expected of their members in the event of a pandemic . in this paper , we address the issue of special obligations of hcps during an infectious disease outbreak . we argue that there is a pressing need to clarify the rights and responsibilities of hcps in the current context of pandemic flu preparedness , and that these rights and responsibilities ought to be codified in professional codes of ethics . finally , we present a brief historical accounting of the treatment of the duty to care in professional health care codes of ethics . summary : an honest and critical examination of the role of hcps during communicable disease outbreaks is needed in order to provide guidelines regarding professional rights and responsibilities , as well as ethical duties and obligations . with this paper , we hope to open the social dialogue and advance the public debate on this increasingly urgent issue ."
epicatechins purified from green tea ( camellia sinensis ) differentially suppress growth of gender - dependent human cancer cell lines .,"the anticancer potential of catechins derived from green tea is not well understood , in part because catechin - related growth suppression and / or apoptosis appears to vary with the type and stage of malignancy as well as with the type of catechin . this in vitro study examined the biological effects of epicatechin ( ec ) , epigallocatechin ( egc ) , ec 3 - gallate ( ecg ) and egc 3 - gallate ( egcg ) in cell lines from human gender - specific cancers . cell lines developed from organ - confined ( hh870 ) and metastatic ( du145 ) prostate cancer , and from moderately ( hh450 ) and poorly differentiated ( hh639 ) epithelial ovarian cancer were grown with or without ec , egc , ecg or egcg . when untreated cells reached confluency , viability and doubling time were measured for treated and untreated cells . whereas ec treatment reduced proliferation of hh639 cells by 50 % , egcg suppressed proliferation of all cell lines by 50 % . ecg was even more potent : it inhibited du145 , hh870 , hh450 and hh639 cells at concentrations of 24 , 27 , 29 and 30 µm , whereas egcg inhibited du145 , hh870 , hh450 and hh639 cells at concentrations 89 , 45 , 62 and 42 µm . when compared with egcg , ecg more effectively suppresses the growth of prostate cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines derived from tumors of patients with different stages of disease ."
markers of exacerbation severity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .,"background : patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) can experience ' exacerbations ' of their conditions . an exacerbation is an event defined in terms of subjective descriptors or symptoms , namely dyspnoea , cough and sputum that worsen sufficiently to warrant a change in medical management . there is a need for reliable markers that reflect the pathological mechanisms that underlie exacerbation severity and that can be used as a surrogate to assess treatment effects in clinical studies . little is known as to how existing study variables and suggested markers change in both the stable and exacerbation phases of copd . in an attempt to find the best surrogates for exacerbations , we have reviewed the literature to identify which of these markers change in a consistent manner with the severity of the exacerbation event . methods : we have searched standard databases between 1966 to july 2004 using major keywords and terms . studies that provided demographics , spirometry , potential markers , and clear eligibility criteria were included in this study . central tendencies and dispersions for all the variables and markers reported and collected by us were first tabulated according to sample size and ats / ers 2004 exacerbation severity levels i to iii criteria . due to the possible similarity of patients in levels ii and iii , the data was also redefined into categories of exacerbations , namely out - patient ( level i ) and in - patient ( levels ii & iii combined ) . for both approaches , we performed a fixed effect meta - analysis on each of the reported variables . results : we included a total of 268 studies reported between 1979 to july 2004 . these studies investigated 142,407 patients with copd . arterial carbon dioxide tension and breathing rate were statistically different between all levels of exacerbation severity and between in out - and in - patient settings . most other measures showed weak relationships with either level or setting , or they had insufficient data to permit meta - analysis . conclusion : arterial carbon dioxide and breathing rate varied in a consistent manner with exacerbation severity and patient setting . many other measures showed weak correlations that should be further explored in future longitudinal studies or assessed using suggested mathematical modelling techniques ."
differentially profiling the low - expression transcriptomes of human hepatoma using a novel ssh / microarray approach .,"background : the main limitation in performing genome - wide gene - expression profiling is the assay of low - expression genes . approaches with high throughput and high sensitivity for assaying low - expression transcripts are urgently needed for functional genomic studies . combination of the suppressive subtractive hybridization ( ssh ) and cdna microarray techniques using the subtracted cdna clones as probes printed on chips has greatly improved the efficiency for fishing out the differentially expressed clones and has been used before . however , it remains tedious and inefficient sequencing works for identifying genes including the great number of redundancy in the subtracted amplicons , and sacrifices the original advantages of high sensitivity of ssh in profiling low - expression transcriptomes . results : we modified the previous combination of ssh and microarray methods by directly using the subtracted amplicons as targets to hybridize the pre-made cdna microarrays ( named as "" ssh / microarray "" ) . mrna prepared from three pairs of hepatoma and non-hepatoma liver tissues was subjected to the ssh / microarray assays , as well as directly to regular cdna microarray assays for comparison . as compared to the original ssh and microarray combination assays , the modified ssh / microarray assays allowed for much easier inspection of the subtraction efficiency and identification of genes in the subtracted amplicons without tedious and inefficient sequencing work . on the other hand , 5015 of the 9376 genes originally filtered out by the regular cdna microarray assays because of low expression became analyzable by the ssh / microarray assays . moreover , the ssh / microarray assays detected about ten times more ( 701 vs. 69 ) hcc differentially expressed genes ( at least a two-fold difference and p < 0.01 ) , particularly for those with rare transcripts , than did the regular cdna microarray assays . the differential expression was validated in 9 randomly selected genes in 18 pairs of hepatoma / non-hepatoma liver tissues using quantitative rt - pcr . the ssh / microarray approaches resulted in identifying many differentially expressed genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle , cell death , signal transduction and cell morphogenesis , suggesting the involvement of multi-biological processes in hepato - carcinogenesis . conclusion : the modified ssh / microarray approach is a simple but high - sensitive and high - efficient tool for differentially profiling the low - expression transcriptomes . it is most adequate for applying to functional genomic studies ."
"from functional genomics to functional immunomics : new challenges , old problems , big rewards .","the development of dna microarray technology a decade ago led to the establishment of functional genomics as one of the most active and successful scientific disciplines today . with the ongoing development of immunomic microarray technology — a spatially addressable , large - scale technology for measurement of specific immunological response — the new challenge of functional immunomics is emerging , which bears similarities to but is also significantly different from functional genomics . immunonic data has been successfully used to identify biological markers involved in autoimmune diseases , allergies , viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) , influenza , diabetes , and responses to cancer vaccines . this review intends to provide a coherent vision of this nascent scientific field , and speculate on future research directions . we discuss at some length issues such as epitope prediction , immunomic microarray technology and its applications , and computation and statistical challenges related to functional immunomics . based on the recent discovery of regulation mechanisms in t cell responses , we envision the use of immunomic microarrays as a tool for advances in systems biology of cellular immune responses , by means of immunomic regulatory network models ."
transmission patterns of smallpox : systematic review of natural outbreaks in europe and north america since world war ii .,"background : because smallpox ( variola major ) may be used as a biological weapon , we reviewed outbreaks in post-world war ii europe and north america in order to understand smallpox transmission patterns . methods : a systematic review was used to identify papers from the national library of medicine , embase , biosis , cochrane library , defense technical information center , worldcat , and reference lists of included publications . two authors reviewed selected papers for smallpox outbreaks . results : 51 relevant outbreaks were identified from 1,389 publications . the median for the effective first generation reproduction rate ( initial r ) was 2 ( range 0 – 38 ) . the majority outbreaks were small ( less than 5 cases ) and contained within one generation . outbreaks with few hospitalized patients had low initial r values ( median of 1 ) and were prolonged if not initially recognized ( median of 3 generations ) ; outbreaks with mostly hospitalized patients had higher initial r values ( median 12 ) and were shorter ( median of 3 generations ) . index cases with an atypical presentation of smallpox were less likely to have been diagnosed with smallpox ; outbreaks in which the index case was not correctly diagnosed were larger ( median of 27.5 cases ) and longer ( median of 3 generations ) compared to outbreaks in which the index case was correctly diagnosed ( median of 3 cases and 1 generation ) . conclusion : patterns of spread during smallpox outbreaks varied with circumstances , but early detection and implementation of control measures is a most important influence on the magnitude of outbreaks . the majority of outbreaks studied in europe and north america were controlled within a few generations if detected early ."
reliability of case definitions for public health surveillance assessed by round - robin test methodology .,"background : case definitions have been recognized to be important elements of public health surveillance systems . they are to assure comparability and consistency of surveillance data and have crucial impact on the sensitivity and the positive predictive value of a surveillance system . the reliability of case definitions has rarely been investigated systematically . methods : we conducted a round - robin test by asking all 425 local health departments ( lhd ) and the 16 state health departments ( shd ) in germany to classify a selection of 68 case examples using case definitions . by multivariate analysis we investigated factors linked to classification agreement with a gold standard , which was defined by an expert panel . results : a total of 7870 classifications were done by 396 lhd ( 93 % ) and all shd . reporting sensitivity was 90.0 % , positive predictive value 76.6 % . polio case examples had the lowest reporting precision , salmonellosis case examples the highest ( or = 0.008 ; ci : 0.005 – 0.013 ) . case definitions with a check - list format of clinical criteria resulted in higher reporting precision than case definitions with a narrative description ( or = 3.08 ; ci : 2.47 – 3.83 ) . reporting precision was higher among shd compared to lhd ( or = 1.52 ; ci : 1.14 – 2.02 ) . conclusion : our findings led to a systematic revision of the german case definitions and build the basis for general recommendations for the creation of case definitions . these include , among others , that testable yes / no criteria in a check - list format is likely to improve reliability , and that software used for data transmission should be designed in strict accordance with the case definitions . the findings of this study are largely applicable to case definitions in many other countries or international networks as they share the same structural and editorial characteristics of the case definitions evaluated in this study before their revision ."
ventilator associated pneumonia and infection control .,"ventilator associated pneumonia ( vap ) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units . the incidence of vap varies from 7 % to 70 % in different studies and the mortality rates are 20 – 75 % according to the study population . aspiration of colonized pathogenic microorganisms on the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract is the main route for the development of vap . on the other hand , the major risk factor for vap is intubation and the duration of mechanical ventilation . diagnosis remains difficult , and studies showed the importance of early initiation of appropriate antibiotic for prognosis . vap causes extra length of stay in hospital and intensive care units and increases hospital cost . consequently , infection control policies are more rational and will save money ."
"sentinel surveillance for human enterovirus 71 in sarawak , malaysia : lessons from the first 7 years .","background : a major outbreak of human enterovirus 71 - associated hand , foot and mouth disease in sarawak in 1997 marked the beginning of a series of outbreaks in the asia pacific region . some of these outbreaks had unusually high numbers of fatalities and this generated much fear and anxiety in the region . methods : we established a sentinel surveillance programme for hand , foot and mouth disease in sarawak , malaysia , in march 1998 , and the observations of the first 7 years are described here . virus isolation , serotyping and genotyping were performed on throat , rectal , vesicle and other swabs . results : during this period sarawak had two outbreaks of human enterovirus 71 , in 2000 and 2003 . the predominant strains circulating in the outbreaks of 1997 , 2000 and 2003 were all from genogroup b , but the strains isolated during each outbreak were genetically distinct from each other . human enterovirus 71 outbreaks occurred in a cyclical pattern every three years and coxsackievirus a16 co-circulated with human enterovirus 71 . although vesicles were most likely to yield an isolate , this sample was not generally available from most cases and obtaining throat swabs was thus found to be the most efficient way to obtain virological information . conclusion : knowledge of the epidemiology of human enterovirus 71 transmission will allow public health personnel to predict when outbreaks might occur and to plan interventions in an effective manner in order to reduce the burden of disease ."
model - based design of growth - attenuated viruses .,"live - virus vaccines activate both humoral and cell - mediated immunity , require only a single boosting , and generally provide longer immune protection than killed or subunit vaccines . however , growth of live - virus vaccines must be attenuated to minimize their potential pathogenic effects , and mechanisms of attenuation by conventional serial - transfer viral adaptation are not well - understood . new methods of attenuation based on rational engineering of viral genomes may offer a potentially greater control if one can link defined genetic modifications to changes in virus growth . to begin to establish such links between genotype and growth phenotype , we developed a computer model for the intracellular growth of vesicular stomatitis virus ( vsv ) , a well - studied , nonsegmented , negative - stranded rna virus . our model incorporated established regulatory mechanisms of vsv while integrating key wild - type infection steps : hijacking of host resources , transcription , translation , and replication , followed by assembly and release of progeny vsv particles . generalization of the wild - type model to allow for genome rearrangements matched the experimentally observed attenuation ranking for recombinant vsv strains that altered the genome position of their nucleocapsid gene . finally , our simulations captured previously reported experimental results showing how altering the positions of other vsv genes has the potential to attenuate the vsv growth while overexpressing the immunogenic vsv surface glycoprotein . such models will facilitate the engineering of new live - virus vaccines by linking genomic manipulations to controlled changes in virus gene - expression and growth ."
delivery systems for the direct application of sirnas to induce rna interference ( rnai ) in vivo .,"rna interference ( rnai ) is a powerful method for specific gene silencing which may also lead to promising novel therapeutic strategies . it is mediated through small interfering rnas ( sirnas ) which sequence - specifically trigger the cleavage and subsequent degradation of their target mrna . one critical factor is the ability to deliver intact sirnas into target cells / organs in vivo . this review highlights the mechanism of rnai and the guidelines for the design of optimal sirnas . it gives an overview of studies based on the systemic or local application of naked sirnas or the use of various nonviral sirna delivery systems . one promising avenue is the the complexation of sirnas with the polyethylenimine ( pei ) , which efficiently stabilizes sirnas and , upon systemic administration , leads to the delivery of the intact sirnas into different organs . the antitumorigenic effects of pei / sirna - mediated in vivo gene - targeting of tumor - relevant proteins like in mouse tumor xenograft models are described ."
electrochemical molecular analysis without nucleic acid amplification .,"electrochemical biosensors have revolutionized glucose monitoring but have not yet fulfilled their promise of a low cost , direct detection replacement for genetic amplification tests such as pcr [ k. kerman , m. kobayashi , e. tamiya , recent trends in electro - chemical dna biosensor technology , meas . sci . technol . 15 ( 2004 ) r1 - r11 ; a. chaubey , b.d. malhotra , mediated biosensors . biosens . bioelectron . 17 ( 6 - 7 ) ( 2002 ) 441 - 456 ] . it has been anticipated that the integration of nanoscale chemical structures such as self - assembled monolayers with electrochemical biosensors would increase sensitivity by decreasing inherent system noise . we have designed a novel biosensing approach incorporating such integration and achieved rapid , ultra-low concentration sensitivities without target amplification . raw samples are mixed with lysis buffer to allow hybridization of nucleic acid targets with anchor and signal probes before immobilizing a signaling enzyme proximate to the biosensor surface . a bias potential is subsequently applied and the secondary byproduct of a cyclic peroxidase reaction measured . further studies have demonstrated the application of our approach in protein , clinical chemistry , and ionic assays ."
identification of new participants in the rainbow trout ( oncorhynchus mykiss ) oocyte maturation and ovulation processes using cdna microarrays .,"background : the hormonal control of oocyte maturation and ovulation as well as the molecular mechanisms of nuclear maturation have been thoroughly studied in fish . in contrast , the other molecular events occurring in the ovary during post-vitellogenesis have received far less attention . methods : nylon microarrays displaying 9152 rainbow trout cdnas were hybridized using rna samples originating from ovarian tissue collected during late vitellogenesis , post-vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation . differentially expressed genes were identified using a statistical analysis . a supervised clustering analysis was performed using only differentially expressed genes in order to identify gene clusters exhibiting similar expression profiles . in addition , specific genes were selected and their preovulatory ovarian expression was analyzed using real - time pcr . results : from the statistical analysis , 310 differentially expressed genes were identified . among those genes , 90 were up - regulated at the time of oocyte maturation while 220 exhibited an opposite pattern . after clustering analysis , 90 clones belonging to 3 gene clusters exhibiting the most remarkable expression patterns were kept for further analysis . using real - time pcr analysis , we observed a strong up - regulation of ion and water transport genes such as aquaporin 4 ( aqp4 ) and pendrin ( slc26 ) . in addition , a dramatic up - regulation of vasotocin ( avt ) gene was observed . furthermore , angiotensin - converting - enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) , coagulation factor v ( cf5 ) , adam 22 , and the chemokine cxcl14 genes exhibited a sharp up - regulation at the time of oocyte maturation . finally , ovarian aromatase ( cyp19a1 ) exhibited a dramatic down - regulation over the post-vitellogenic period while a down - regulation of cytidine monophosphate - n - acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase ( cmah ) was observed at the time of oocyte maturation . conclusion : we showed the over or under expression of more that 300 genes , most of them being previously unstudied or unknown in the fish preovulatory ovary . our data confirmed the down - regulation of estrogen synthesis genes during the preovulatory period . in addition , the strong up - regulation of aqp4 and slc26 genes prior to ovulation suggests their participation in the oocyte hydration process occurring at that time . furthermore , among the most up - regulated clones , several genes such as cxcl14 , ace2 , adam22 , cf5 have pro-inflammatory , vasodilatory , proteolytics and coagulatory functions . the identity and expression patterns of those genes support the theory comparing ovulation to an inflammatory - like reaction ."
an object simulation model for modeling hypothetical disease epidemics – epiflex .,"background : epiflex is a flexible , easy to use computer model for a single computer , intended to be operated by one user who need not be an expert . its purpose is to study in - silico the epidemic behavior of a wide variety of diseases , both known and theoretical , by simulating their spread at the level of individuals contracting and infecting others . to understand the system fully , this paper must be read together in conjunction with study of the software and its results . epiflex is evaluated using results from modeling influenza a epidemics and comparing them with a variety of field data sources and other types of modeling . epiflex is an object - oriented monte carlo system , allocating entities to correspond to individuals , disease vectors , diseases , and the locations that hosts may inhabit . epiflex defines eight different contact types available for a disease . contacts occur inside locations within the model . populations are composed of demographic groups , each of which has a cycle of movement between locations . within locations , superspreading is defined by skewing of contact distributions . results : epiflex indicates three phenomena of interest for public health : ( 1 ) r ( 0 ) is variable , and the smaller the population , the larger the infected fraction within that population will be ; ( 2 ) significant compression / synchronization between cities by a factor of roughly 2 occurs between the early incubation phase of a multi-city epidemic and the major manifestation phase ; ( 3 ) if better true morbidity data were available , more asymptomatic hosts would be seen to spread disease than we currently believe is the case for influenza . these results suggest that field research to study such phenomena , while expensive , should be worthwhile . conclusion : since epiflex shows all stages of disease progression , detailed insight into the progress of epidemics is possible . epiflex shows the characteristic multimodality and apparently random variation characteristic of real world data , but does so as an emergent property of a carefully constructed model of disease dynamics and is not simply a stochastic system . epiflex can provide a better understanding of infectious diseases and strategies for response ."
multiplexed genetic analysis using an expanded genetic alphabet .,"background : all states require some kind of testing for newborns , but the policies are far from standardized . in some states , newborn screening may include genetic tests for a wide range of targets , but the costs and complexities of the newer genetic tests inhibit expansion of newborn screening . we describe the development and technical evaluation of a multiplex platform that may foster increased newborn genetic screening . methods : multicode ( ® ) plx involves three major steps : pcr , target - specific extension , and liquid chip decoding . each step is performed in the same reaction vessel , and the test is completed in ~ 3 h. for site - specific labeling and room - temperature decoding , we use an additional base pair constructed from isoguanosine and isocytidine . we used the method to test for mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( cftr ) gene . the developed test was performed manually and by automated liquid handling . initially , 225 samples with a range of genotypes were tested retrospectively with the method . a prospective study used samples from > 400 newborns . results : in the retrospective study , 99.1 % of samples were correctly genotyped with no incorrect calls made . in the perspective study , 95 % of the samples were correctly genotyped for all targets , and there were no incorrect calls . conclusions : the unique genetic multiplexing platform was successfully able to test for 31 targets within the cftr gene and provides accurate genotype assignments in a clinical setting ."
antisense - induced ribosomal frameshifting .,"programmed ribosomal frameshifting provides a mechanism to decode information located in two overlapping reading frames by diverting a proportion of translating ribosomes into a second open reading frame ( orf ) . the result is the production of two proteins : the product of standard translation from orf1 and an orf1 – orf2 fusion protein . such programmed frameshifting is commonly utilized as a gene expression mechanism in viruses that infect eukaryotic cells and in a subset of cellular genes . rna secondary structures , consisting of pseudoknots or stem – loops , located downstream of the shift site often act as cis - stimulators of frameshifting . here , we demonstrate for the first time that antisense oligonucleotides can functionally mimic these rna structures to induce +1 ribosomal frameshifting when annealed downstream of the frameshift site , ucc uga . antisense - induced shifting of the ribosome into the +1 reading frame is highly efficient in both rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions and in cultured mammalian cells . the efficiency of antisense - induced frameshifting at this site is responsive to the sequence context 5 ′ of the shift site and to polyamine levels ."
the gene of an archaeal α - l - fucosidase is expressed by translational frameshifting .,"the standard rules of genetic translational decoding are altered in specific genes by different events that are globally termed recoding . in archaea recoding has been unequivocally determined so far only for termination codon readthrough events . we study here the mechanism of expression of a gene encoding for a α - l - fucosidase from the archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus ( fuca1 ) , which is split in two open reading frames separated by a − 1 frameshifting . the expression in escherichia coli of the wild - type split gene led to the production by frameshifting of full - length polypeptides with an efficiency of 5 % . mutations in the regulatory site where the shift takes place demonstrate that the expression in vivo occurs in a programmed way . further , we identify a full - length product of fuca1 in s.solfataricus extracts , which translate this gene in vitro by following programmed − 1 frameshifting . this is the first experimental demonstration that this kind of recoding is present in archaea ."
role of rna helicases in hiv - 1 replication .,"viruses are replication competent genomes which are relatively gene - poor . even the largest viruses ( i.e. herpesviruses ) encode only slightly > 200 open reading frames ( orfs ) . however , because viruses replicate obligatorily inside cells , and considering that evolution may be driven by a principle of economy of scale , it is reasonable to surmise that many viruses have evolved the ability to co-opt cell - encoded proteins to provide needed surrogate functions . an in silico survey of viral sequence databases reveals that most positive - strand and double - stranded rna viruses have orfs for rna helicases . on the other hand , the genomes of retroviruses are devoid of virally - encoded helicase . here , we review in brief the notion that the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv - 1 ) has adopted the ability to use one or more cellular rna helicases for its replicative life cycle ."
mimox : a web tool for phage display based epitope mapping .,"background : phage display is widely used in basic research such as the exploration of protein - protein interaction sites and networks , and applied research such as the development of new drugs , vaccines , and diagnostics . it has also become a promising method for epitope mapping . research on new algorithms that assist and automate phage display based epitope mapping has attracted many groups . most of the existing tools have not been implemented as an online service until now however , making it less convenient for the community to access , utilize , and evaluate them . results : we present mimox , a free web tool that helps to map the native epitope of an antibody based on one or more user supplied mimotopes and the antigen structure . mimox was coded in perl using modules from the bioperl project . it has two sections . in the first section , mimox provides a simple interface for clustalw to align a set of mimotopes . it also provides a simple statistical method to derive the consensus sequence and embeds jalview as a java applet to view and manage the alignment . in the second section , mimox can map a single mimotope or a consensus sequence of a set of mimotopes , on to the corresponding antigen structure and search for all of the clusters of residues that could represent the native epitope . naccess is used to evaluate the surface accessibility of the candidate clusters ; and jmol is embedded to view them interactively in their 3d context . initial case studies show that mimox can reproduce mappings from existing tools such as findmap and 3dex , as well as providing novel , rational results . conclusion : a web - based tool called mimox has been developed for phage display based epitope mapping . as a publicly available online service in this area , it is convenient for the community to access , utilize , and evaluate , complementing other existing programs . mimox is freely available at ."
endogenous cell repair of chronic demyelination .,"in multiple sclerosis lesions , remyelination typically fails with repeated or chronic demyelinating episodes and results in neurologic disability . acute demyelination models in rodents typically exhibit robust spontaneous remyelination that prevents appropriate evaluation of strategies for improving conditions of insufficient remyelination . in the current study , we used a mouse model of chronic demyelination induced by continuous ingestion of 0.2 % cuprizone for 12 weeks . this chronic process depleted the oligodendrocyte progenitor population and impaired oligodendrocyte regeneration . remyelination remained limited after removal of cuprizone from the diet . fibroblast growth factor 2 ( fgf2 ) expression was persistently increased in the corpus callosum of chronically demyelinated mice as compared with nonlesioned mice . we used fgf2 ( − / − ) mice to determine whether removal of endogenous fgf2 promoted remyelination of chronically demyelinated areas . wild - type and fgf2 ( − / − ) mice exhibited similar demyelination during chronic cuprizone treatment . importantly , in contrast to wild - type mice , the fgf2 ( − / − ) mice spontaneously remyelinated completely during the recovery period after chronic demyelination . increased remyelination in fgf2 ( − / − ) mice correlated with enhanced oligodendroglial regeneration . fgf2 genotype did not alter the density of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or proliferating cells after chronic demyelination . these findings indicate that attenuating fgf2 created a sufficiently permissive lesion environment for endogenous cells to effectively remyelinate viable axons even after chronic demyelination ."
automated identification of multiple micro-organisms from resequencing dna microarrays .,"there is an increasing recognition that detailed nucleic acid sequence information will be useful and even required in the diagnosis , treatment and surveillance of many significant pathogens . because generating detailed information about pathogens leads to significantly larger amounts of data , it is necessary to develop automated analysis methods to reduce analysis time and to standardize identification criteria . this is especially important for multiple pathogen assays designed to reduce assay time and costs . in this paper , we present a successful algorithm for detecting pathogens and reporting the maximum level of detail possible using multi-pathogen resequencing microarrays . the algorithm filters the sequence of base calls from the microarray and finds entries in genetic databases that most closely match . taxonomic databases are then used to relate these entries to each other so that the microorganism can be identified . although developed using a resequencing microarray , the approach is applicable to any assay method that produces base call sequence information . the success and continued development of this approach means that a non-expert can now perform unassisted analysis of the results obtained from partial sequence data ."
molecular dynamics simulations of human [ formula : see text ] : the role of modified bases in mrna recognition .,"accuracy in translation of the genetic code into proteins depends upon correct trna – mrna recognition in the context of the ribosome . in human [ formula : see text ] three modified bases are present in the anticodon stem – loop — 2 - methylthio - n6 - threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37 ( ms ( 2 ) t ( 6 ) a37 ) , 5 - methoxycarbonylmethyl -2-thiouridine at position 34 ( mcm ( 5 ) s ( 2 ) u34 ) and pseudouridine ( ψ ) at position 39 — two of which , ms ( 2 ) t ( 6 ) a37 and mcm ( 5 ) s ( 2 ) u34 , are required to achieve wild - type binding activity of wild - type human [ formula : see text ] [ c. yarian , m. marszalek , e. sochacka , a. malkiewicz , r. guenther , a. miskiewicz and p. f. agris ( 2000 ) biochemistry , 39 , 13390 – 13395 ] . molecular dynamics simulations of nine trna anticodon stem – loops with different combinations of nonstandard bases were performed . the wild - type simulation exhibited a canonical anticodon stair - stepped conformation . the ms ( 2 ) t ( 6 ) modification at position 37 is required for maintenance of this structure and reduces solvent accessibility of u36 . ms ( 2 ) t ( 6 ) a37 generally hydrogen bonds across the loop and may prevent u36 from rotating into solution . a water molecule does coordinate to ψ39 most of the simulation time but weakly , as most of the residence lifetimes are < 40 ps ."
a novel endonuclease iv post-pcr genotyping system .,"here we describe a novel endonuclease iv ( endo iv ) based assay utilizing a substrate that mimics the abasic lesions that normally occur in double - stranded dna . the three component substrate is characterized by single - stranded dna target , an oligonucleotide probe , separated from a helper oligonucleotide by a one base gap . the oligonucleotide probe contains a non-fluorescent quencher at the 5 ′ end and fluorophore attached to the 3 ′ end through a special rigid linker . fluorescence of the oligonucleotide probe is efficiently quenched by the interaction of terminal dye and quencher when not hybridized . upon hybridization of the oligonucleotide probe and helper probe to their complementary target , the phosphodiester linkage between the rigid linker and the 3 ′ end of the probe is efficiently cleaved , generating a fluorescent signal . in this study , the use of the endo iv assay as a post-pcr amplification detection system is demonstrated . high sensitivity and specificity are illustrated using single nucleotide polymorphism detection ."
pandemic influenza preparedness : an ethical framework to guide decision - making .,"background : planning for the next pandemic influenza outbreak is underway in hospitals across the world . the global sars experience has taught us that ethical frameworks to guide decision - making may help to reduce collateral damage and increase trust and solidarity within and between health care organisations . good pandemic planning requires reflection on values because science alone can not tell us how to prepare for a public health crisis . discussion : in this paper , we present an ethical framework for pandemic influenza planning . the ethical framework was developed with expertise from clinical , organisational and public health ethics and validated through a stakeholder engagement process . the ethical framework includes both substantive and procedural elements for ethical pandemic influenza planning . the incorporation of ethics into pandemic planning can be helped by senior hospital administrators sponsoring its use , by having stakeholders vet the framework , and by designing or identifying decision review processes . we discuss the merits and limits of an applied ethical framework for hospital decision - making , as well as the robustness of the framework . summary : the need for reflection on the ethical issues raised by the spectre of a pandemic influenza outbreak is great . our efforts to address the normative aspects of pandemic planning in hospitals have generated interest from other hospitals and from the governmental sector . the framework will require re-evaluation and refinement and we hope that this paper will generate feedback on how to make it even more robust ."
open lung biopsy in early - stage acute respiratory distress syndrome .,"introduction : acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) has heterogeneous etiologies , rapid progressive change and a high mortality rate . to improve the outcome of ards , accurate diagnosis is essential to the application of effective early treatment . the present study investigated the clinical effects and safety of open lung biopsy ( olb ) in patients with early - stage ards of suspected non-infectious origin . methods : we undertook a retrospective study of 41 patients with early - stage ards ( defined as one week or less after intubation ) who underwent olb in two medical intensive care units of a tertiary care hospital from 1999 to 2005 . data analyzed included baseline characteristics , complication rate , pathological diagnoses , treatment alterations , and hospital survival . results : the age of patients was 55 ± 17 years ( mean ± sd ) . the average ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen ( pao ( 2 ) ) to fraction of inspired oxygen ( fio ( 2 ) ) was 116 ± 43 mmhg ( mean ± sd ) at biopsy . seventeen patients ( 41 % ) were immunocompromised . postoperative complications occurred in 20 % of patients ( 8/41 ) . all biopsies provided a pathological diagnosis with a diagnostic yield of 100 % . specific pathological diagnoses were made for 44 % of patients ( 18/41 ) . biopsy findings led to an alteration of treatment modality in 73 % of patients ( 30/41 ) . the treatment alteration rate was higher in patients with nonspecific diagnoses than in patients with specific diagnoses ( p = 0.0024 ) . overall mortality was 50 % ( 21/41 ) and was not influenced by age , gender , pre-olb oxygenation , complication rate , pathological results , and alteration of treatment . there was no surgery - related mortality . the survival rate for immunocompromised patients was better than that for immunocompetent patients ( 71 % versus 33 % ; p = 0.0187 ) in this study . conclusion : our retrospective study suggests that olb was a useful and acceptably safe diagnostic procedure in some selected patients with early - stage ards ."
association and host selectivity in multi-host pathogens .,"the distribution of multi-host pathogens over their host range conditions their population dynamics and structure . also , host co-infection by different pathogens may have important consequences for the evolution of hosts and pathogens , and host - pathogen co-evolution . hence it is of interest to know if the distribution of pathogens over their host range is random , or if there are associations between hosts and pathogens , or between pathogens sharing a host . to analyse these issues we propose indices for the observed patterns of host infection by pathogens , and for the observed patterns of co-infection , and tests to analyse if these patterns conform to randomness or reflect associations . applying these tests to the prevalence of five plant viruses on 21 wild plant species evidenced host - virus associations : most hosts and viruses were selective for viruses and hosts , respectively . interestingly , the more host - selective viruses were the more prevalent ones , suggesting that host specialisation is a successful strategy for multi-host pathogens . analyses also showed that viruses tended to associate positively in co-infected hosts . the developed indices and tests provide the tools to analyse how strong and common are these associations among different groups of pathogens , which will help to understand and model the population biology of multi-host pathogens ."
the effectiveness of contact tracing in emerging epidemics .,"background : contact tracing plays an important role in the control of emerging infectious diseases , but little is known yet about its effectiveness . here we deduce from a generic mathematical model how effectiveness of tracing relates to various aspects of time , such as the course of individual infectivity , the ( variability in ) time between infection and symptom - based detection , and delays in the tracing process . in addition , the possibility of iteratively tracing of yet asymptomatic infecteds is considered . with these insights we explain why contact tracing was and will be effective for control of smallpox and sars , only partially effective for foot - and - mouth disease , and likely not effective for influenza . methods and findings : we investigate contact tracing in a model of an emerging epidemic that is flexible enough to use for most infections . we consider isolation of symptomatic infecteds as the basic scenario , and express effectiveness as the proportion of contacts that need to be traced for a reproduction ratio smaller than 1 . we obtain general results for special cases , which are interpreted with respect to the likely success of tracing for influenza , smallpox , sars , and foot - and - mouth disease epidemics . conclusions : we conclude that ( 1 ) there is no general predictive formula for the proportion to be traced as there is for the proportion to be vaccinated ; ( 2 ) variability in time to detection is favourable for effective tracing ; ( 3 ) tracing effectiveness need not be sensitive to the duration of the latent period and tracing delays ; ( 4 ) iterative tracing primarily improves effectiveness when single - step tracing is on the brink of being effective ."
the waiting time for inter-country spread of pandemic influenza .,"background : the time delay between the start of an influenza pandemic and its subsequent initiation in other countries is highly relevant to preparedness planning . we quantify the distribution of this random time in terms of the separate components of this delay , and assess how the delay may be extended by non-pharmaceutical interventions . methods and findings : the model constructed for this time delay accounts for : ( i ) epidemic growth in the source region , ( ii ) the delay until an infected individual from the source region seeks to travel to an at - risk country , ( iii ) the chance that infected travelers are detected by screening at exit and entry borders , ( iv ) the possibility of in - flight transmission , ( v ) the chance that an infected arrival might not initiate an epidemic , and ( vi ) the delay until infection in the at - risk country gathers momentum . efforts that reduce the disease reproduction number in the source region below two and severe travel restrictions are most effective for delaying a local epidemic , and under favourable circumstances , could add several months to the delay . on the other hand , the model predicts that border screening for symptomatic infection , wearing a protective mask during travel , promoting early presentation of cases arising among arriving passengers and moderate reduction in travel volumes increase the delay only by a matter of days or weeks . elevated in - flight transmission reduces the delay only minimally . conclusions : the delay until an epidemic of pandemic strain influenza is imported into an at - risk country is largely determined by the course of the epidemic in the source region and the number of travelers attempting to enter the at - risk country , and is little affected by non-pharmaceutical interventions targeting these travelers . short of preventing international travel altogether , eradicating a nascent pandemic in the source region appears to be the only reliable method of preventing country - to - country spread of a pandemic strain of influenza ."
neutralizing antibody fails to impact the course of ebola virus infection in monkeys .,"prophylaxis with high doses of neutralizing antibody typically offers protection against challenge with viruses producing acute infections . in this study , we have investigated the ability of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody , kz52 , to protect against ebola virus in rhesus macaques . this antibody was previously shown to fully protect guinea pigs from infection . four rhesus macaques were given 50 mg / kg of neutralizing human monoclonal antibody kz52 intravenously 1 d before challenge with 1,000 plaque - forming units of ebola virus , followed by a second dose of 50 mg / kg antibody 4 d after challenge . a control animal was exposed to virus in the absence of antibody treatment . passive transfer of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody not only failed to protect macaques against challenge with ebola virus but also had a minimal effect on the explosive viral replication following infection . we show that the inability of antibody to impact infection was not due to neutralization escape . it appears that ebola virus has a mechanism of infection propagation in vivo in macaques that is uniquely insensitive even to high concentrations of neutralizing antibody ."
public health preparedness in alberta : a systems - level study .,"background : recent international and national events have brought critical attention to the canadian public health system and how prepared the system is to respond to various types of contemporary public health threats . this article describes the study design and methods being used to conduct a systems - level analysis of public health preparedness in the province of alberta , canada . the project is being funded under the health research fund , alberta heritage foundation for medical research . methods / design : we use an embedded , multiple - case study design , integrating qualitative and quantitative methods to measure empirically the degree of inter-organizational coordination existing among public health agencies in alberta , canada . we situate our measures of inter-organizational network ties within a systems - level framework to assess the relative influence of inter-organizational ties , individual organizational attributes , and institutional environmental features on public health preparedness . the relative contribution of each component is examined for two potential public health threats : pandemic influenza and west nile virus . discussion : the organizational dimensions of public health preparedness depend on a complex mix of individual organizational characteristics , inter-agency relationships , and institutional environmental factors . our study is designed to discriminate among these different system components and assess the independent influence of each on the other , as well as the overall level of public health preparedness in alberta . while all agree that competent organizations and functioning networks are important components of public health preparedness , this study is one of the first to use formal network analysis to study the role of inter-agency networks in the development of prepared public health systems ."
the immunoregulatory and allergy - associated cytokines in the aetiology of the otitis media with effusion .,"inflammation in the middle ear mucosa , which can be provoked by different primary factors such as bacterial and viral infection , local allergic reactions and reflux , is the crucial event in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion ( ome ) . unresolved acute inflammatory responses or defective immunoregulation of middle inflammation can promote chronic inflammatory processes and stimulate the chronic condition of ome . cytokines are the central molecular regulators of middle ear inflammation and can switch the acute phase of inflammation in the chronic stage and induce molecular - pathological processes leading to the histopathological changes accompanying ome . in this review we present cytokines identified in otitis media , immunoregulatory [ interleukin ( il ) - 2 , il - 10 , transforming growth factor - beta ] ) and allergy associated ( il - 4 , il - 5 , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ) , as crucial molecular regulators , responsible for chronic inflammation in the middle ear and the chronic condition of ome ."
"bench - to - bedside review : critical illness - associated cognitive dysfunction – mechanisms , markers , and emerging therapeutics .","cognitive dysfunction is common in critically ill patients , not only during the acute illness but also long after its resolution . a large number of pathophysiologic mechanisms are thought to underlie critical illness - associated cognitive dysfunction , including neuro - transmitter abnormalities and occult diffuse brain injury . markers that could be used to evaluate the influence of specific mechanisms in individual patients include serum anticholinergic activity , certain brain proteins , and tissue sodium concentration determination via high - resolution three - dimensional magnetic resonance imaging . although recent therapeutic advances in this area are exciting , they are still too immature to influence patient care . additional research is needed if we are to understand better the relative contributions of specific mechanisms to the development of critical illness - associated cognitive dysfunction and to determine whether these mechanisms might be amenable to treatment or prevention ."
procat : a data analysis approach for protein microarrays .,"protein microarrays provide a versatile method for the analysis of many protein biochemical activities . existing dna microarray analytical methods do not translate to protein microarrays due to differences between the technologies . here we report a new approach , procat , which corrects for background bias and spatial artifacts , identifies significant signals , filters nonspecific spots , and normalizes the resulting signal to protein abundance . procat provides a powerful and flexible new approach for analyzing many types of protein microarrays ."
positional clustering improves computational binding site detection and identifies novel cis - regulatory sites in mammalian gaba ( a ) receptor subunit genes .,"understanding transcription factor ( tf ) mediated control of gene expression remains a major challenge at the interface of computational and experimental biology . computational techniques predicting tf - binding site specificity are frequently unreliable . on the other hand , comprehensive experimental validation is difficult and time consuming . we introduce a simple strategy that dramatically improves robustness and accuracy of computational binding site prediction . first , we evaluate the rate of recurrence of computational tfbs predictions by commonly used sampling procedures . we find that the vast majority of results are biologically meaningless . however clustering results based on nucleotide position improves predictive power . additionally , we find that positional clustering increases robustness to long or imperfectly selected input sequences . positional clustering can also be used as a mechanism to integrate results from multiple sampling approaches for improvements in accuracy over each one alone . finally , we predict and validate regulatory sequences partially responsible for transcriptional control of the mammalian type a γ - aminobutyric acid receptor ( gaba ( a ) r ) subunit genes . positional clustering is useful for improving computational binding site predictions , with potential application to improving our understanding of mammalian gene expression . in particular , predicted regulatory mechanisms in the mammalian gaba ( a ) r subunit gene family may open new avenues of research towards understanding this pharmacologically important neurotransmitter receptor system ."
the transmissibility of highly pathogenic avian influenza in commercial poultry in industrialised countries .,"background : with the increased occurrence of outbreaks of h5n1 worldwide there is concern that the virus could enter commercial poultry farms with severe economic consequences . methodology / principal findings : we analyse data from four recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza ( hpai ) in commercial poultry to estimate the farm - to - farm reproductive number for hpai . the reproductive number is a key measure of the transmissibility of hpai at the farm level because it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures . in these outbreaks the mean farm - to - farm reproductive number prior to controls ranged from 1.1 to 2.4 , with the maximum farm - based reproductive number in the range 2.2 to 3.2 . enhanced bio-security , movement restrictions and prompt isolation of the infected farms in all four outbreaks substantially reduced the reproductive number , but it remained close to the threshold value 1 necessary to ensure the disease will be eradicated . conclusions / significance : our results show that depending on the particular situation in which an outbreak of avian influenza occurs , current controls might not be enough to eradicate the disease , and therefore a close monitoring of the outbreak is required . the method we used for estimating the reproductive number is straightforward to implement and can be used in real - time . it therefore can be a useful tool to inform policy decisions ."
the influenza pandemic preparedness planning tool influsim .,"background : planning public health responses against pandemic influenza relies on predictive models by which the impact of different intervention strategies can be evaluated . research has to date rather focused on producing predictions for certain localities or under specific conditions , than on designing a publicly available planning tool which can be applied by public health administrations . here , we provide such a tool which is reproducible by an explicitly formulated structure and designed to operate with an optimal combination of the competing requirements of precision , realism and generality . results : influsim is a deterministic compartment model based on a system of over 1,000 differential equations which extend the classic seir model by clinical and demographic parameters relevant for pandemic preparedness planning . it allows for producing time courses and cumulative numbers of influenza cases , outpatient visits , applied antiviral treatment doses , hospitalizations , deaths and work days lost due to sickness , all of which may be associated with economic aspects . the software is programmed in java , operates platform independent and can be executed on regular desktop computers . conclusion : influsim is an online available software which efficiently assists public health planners in designing optimal interventions against pandemic influenza . it can reproduce the infection dynamics of pandemic influenza like complex computer simulations while offering at the same time reproducibility , higher computational performance and better operability ."
immune pathways and defence mechanisms in honey bees apis mellifera .,"social insects are able to mount both group - level and individual defences against pathogens . here we focus on individual defences , by presenting a genome - wide analysis of immunity in a social insect , the honey bee apis mellifera . we present honey bee models for each of four signalling pathways associated with immunity , identifying plausible orthologues for nearly all predicted pathway members . when compared to the sequenced drosophila and anopheles genomes , honey bees possess roughly one - third as many genes in 17 gene families implicated in insect immunity . we suggest that an implied reduction in immune flexibility in bees reflects either the strength of social barriers to disease , or a tendency for bees to be attacked by a limited set of highly coevolved pathogens ."
"elad , a deubiquitinating protease expressed by e. coli .","background : ubiquitin and ubiquitin - like proteins ( ubl ) are designed to modify polypeptides in eukaryotes . covalent binding of ubiquitin or ubls to substrate proteins can be reversed by specific hydrolases . one particular set of cysteine proteases , the ce clan , which targets ubiquitin and ubls , has homologs in eukaryotes , prokaryotes , and viruses . findings : we have cloned and analyzed the e. coli protein elad , which is distantly related to eukaryotic ce clan members of the ulp / senp protease family that are specific for sumo and nedd8 . previously misannotated as a putative sulfatase / phosphatase , elad is an efficient and specific deubiquitinating enzyme in vitro . interestingly , elad is present in all intestinal pathogenic e. coli strains , but conspicuously absent from extraintestinal pathogenic strains ( expecs ) . further homologs of this protease can be found in acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus , and in alpha - , beta - and gammaproteobacteria . conclusion : the expression of ulp / senp - related hydrolases in bacteria therefore extends to plant pathogens and medically relevant strains of escherichia coli , legionella pneumophila , rickettsiae , chlamydiae , and salmonellae , in which the elad ortholog ssel has recently been identified as a virulence factor with deubiquitinating activity . as a counterpoint , our phylogenetic and functional examination reveals that ancient eukaryotic ulp / senp proteases also have the potential of ubiquitin - specific hydrolysis , suggesting an early common origin of this peptidase clan ."
mutational analysis of human ceacam1 : the potential of receptor polymorphism in increasing host susceptibility to bacterial infection .,"a common overlapping site on the n - terminal igv - like domain of human carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) - related cell adhesion molecules ( ceacams ) is targeted by several important human respiratory pathogens . these include neisseria meningitidis ( nm ) and haemophilus influenzae ( hi ) that can cause disseminated or persistent localized infections . to define the precise structural features that determine the binding of distinct pathogens with ceacams , we have undertaken molecular modelling and mutation of the receptor molecules at previously implicated key target residues required for bacterial binding . these include ser - 32 , tyr - 34 , val - 39 , gln - 44 and gln - 89 , in addition to ile - 91 , the primary docking site for the pathogens . most , but not all , of these residues located adjacent to each other in a previous n - domain model of human ceacam1 , which was based on rei , cd2 and cd4 . in the current studies , we have refined this model based on the mouse ceacam1 crystal structure , and observe that all of the above residues form an exposed continuous binding region on the n - domain . examination of the model also suggested that substitution of two of these residues 34 and 89 could affect the accessibility of ile - 91 for ligand binding . by introducing selected mutations at the positions 91 , 34 and 89 , we confirmed the primary importance of ile - 91 in all bacterial binding to ceacam1 despite the inter - and intraspecies structural differences between the bacterial ceacam - binding ligands . the studies further indicated that the efficiency of binding was significantly enhanced for specific strains by mutations such as y34f and q89n , which also altered the hierarchy of nm versus hi strain binding . these studies imply that distinct polymorphisms in human epithelial ceacams have the potential to decrease or increase the risk of infection by the receptor - targeting pathogens ."
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( iris ) : review of common infectious manifestations and treatment options .,"the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( iris ) in hiv - infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy ( art ) results from restored immunity to specific infectious or non-infectious antigens . a paradoxical clinical worsening of a known condition or the appearance of a new condition after initiating therapy characterizes the syndrome . potential mechanisms for the syndrome include a partial recovery of the immune system or exuberant host immunological responses to antigenic stimuli . the overall incidence of iris is unknown , but is dependent on the population studied and its underlying opportunistic infectious burden . the infectious pathogens most frequently implicated in the syndrome are mycobacteria , varicella zoster , herpesviruses , and cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) . no single treatment option exists and depends on the underlying infectious agent and its clinical presentation . prospective cohort studies addressing the optimal screening and treatment of opportunistic infections in patients eligible for art are currently being conducted . these studies will provide evidence for the development of treatment guidelines in order to reduce the burden of iris . we review the available literature on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of iris , and present treatment options for the more common infectious manifestations of this diverse syndrome and for manifestations associated with a high morbidity ."
global surveillance of emerging influenza virus genotypes by mass spectrometry .,"background : effective influenza surveillance requires new methods capable of rapid and inexpensive genomic analysis of evolving viral species for pandemic preparedness , to understand the evolution of circulating viral species , and for vaccine strain selection . we have developed one such approach based on previously described broad - range reverse transcription pcr / electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( rt - pcr / esi - ms ) technology . methods and principal findings : analysis of base compositions of rt - pcr amplicons from influenza core gene segments ( pb1 , pb2 , pa , m , ns , np ) are used to provide sub-species identification and infer influenza virus h and n subtypes . using this approach , we detected and correctly identified 92 mammalian and avian influenza isolates , representing 30 different h and n types , including 29 avian h5n1 isolates . further , direct analysis of 656 human clinical respiratory specimens collected over a seven - year period ( 1999 – 2006 ) showed correct identification of the viral species and subtypes with > 97 % sensitivity and specificity . base composition derived clusters inferred from this analysis showed 100 % concordance to previously established clades . ongoing surveillance of samples from the recent influenza virus seasons ( 2005 – 2006 ) showed evidence for emergence and establishment of new genotypes of circulating h3n2 strains worldwide . mixed viral quasispecies were found in approximately 1 % of these recent samples providing a view into viral evolution . conclusion / significance : thus , rapid rt - pcr / esi - ms analysis can be used to simultaneously identify all species of influenza viruses with clade - level resolution , identify mixed viral populations and monitor global spread and emergence of novel viral genotypes . this high - throughput method promises to become an integral component of influenza surveillance ."
transmission parameters of the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic in great britain .,"despite intensive ongoing research , key aspects of the spatial - temporal evolution of the 2001 foot and mouth disease ( fmd ) epidemic in great britain ( gb ) remain unexplained . here we develop a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models . we make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001 , equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with fmd were not infectious , even if some were infected . we estimate how transmission parameters varied through time , highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic . we demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species . predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of gb are presented for the fitted models ."
efficient replication of pneumonia virus of mice ( pvm ) in a mouse macrophage cell line .,"pneumonia virus of mice ( pvm ; family paramyxoviridae , subfamily pneumovirinae ) is a natural respiratory pathogen of rodent species and an important new model for the study of severe viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia . however , despite high virus titers typically detected in infected mouse lung tissue in vivo , cell lines used routinely for virus propagation in vitro are not highly susceptible to pvm infection . we have evaluated several rodent and primate cell lines for susceptibility to pvm infection , and detected highest virus titers from infection of the mouse monocyte - macrophage raw 264.7 cell line . additionally , virus replication in raw 264.7 cells induces the synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines relevant to respiratory virus disease , including tumor necrosis factor - α ( tnf - α ) , interferon - β ( ifn - β ) , macrophage inflammatory proteins 1α and 1β ( mip - 1α and mip - 1β ) and the functional homolog of human il - 8 , mouse macrophage inflammatory peptide - 2 ( mip - 2 ) . identification and characterization of a rodent cell line that supports the replication of pvm and induces the synthesis of disease - related proinflammatory mediators will facilitate studies of molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis that will complement and expand on findings from mouse model systems ."
designing and conducting tabletop exercises to assess public health preparedness for manmade and naturally occurring biological threats .,"background : since 2001 , state and local health departments in the united states ( us ) have accelerated efforts to prepare for high - impact public health emergencies . one component of these activities has been the development and conduct of exercise programs to assess capabilities , train staff and build relationships . this paper summarizes lessons learned from tabletop exercises about public health emergency preparedness and about the process of developing , conducting , and evaluating them . methods : we developed , conducted , and evaluated 31 tabletop exercises in partnership with state and local health departments throughout the us from 2003 to 2006 . participant self evaluations , after action reports , and tabletop exercise evaluation forms were used to identify aspects of the exercises themselves , as well as public health emergency responses that participants found more or less challenging , and to highlight lessons learned about tabletop exercise design . results : designing the exercises involved substantial collaboration with representatives from participating health departments to assure that the scenarios were credible , focused attention on local preparedness needs and priorities , and were logistically feasible to implement . during execution of the exercises , nearly all health departments struggled with a common set of challenges relating to disease surveillance , epidemiologic investigations , communications , command and control , and health care surge capacity . in contrast , performance strengths were more varied across participating sites , reflecting specific attributes of individual health departments or communities , experience with actual public health emergencies , or the emphasis of prior preparedness efforts . conclusion : the design , conduct , and evaluation of the tabletop exercises described in this report benefited from collaborative planning that involved stakeholders from participating health departments and exercise developers and facilitators from outside the participating agencies . while these exercises identified both strengths and vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness , additional work is needed to develop reliable metrics to gauge exercise performance , inform follow - up action steps , and to develop re-evaluation exercise designs that assess the impact of post-exercise interventions ."
transcript - level annotation of affymetrix probesets improves the interpretation of gene expression data .,"background : the wide use of affymetrix microarray in broadened fields of biological research has made the probeset annotation an important issue . standard affymetrix probeset annotation is at gene level , i.e. a probeset is precisely linked to a gene , and probeset intensity is interpreted as gene expression . the increased knowledge that one gene may have multiple transcript variants clearly brings up the necessity of updating this gene - level annotation to a refined transcript - level . results : through performing rigorous alignments of the affymetrix probe sequences against a comprehensive pool of currently available transcript sequences , and further linking the probesets to the international protein index , we generated transcript - level or protein - level annotation tables for two popular affymetrix expression arrays , mouse genome 430a 2.0 array and human genome u133a array . application of our new annotations in re-examining existing expression data sets shows increased expression consistency among synonymous probesets and strengthened expression correlation between interacting proteins . conclusion : by refining the standard affymetrix annotation of microarray probesets from the gene level to the transcript level and protein level , one can achieve a more reliable interpretation of their experimental data , which may lead to discovery of more profound regulatory mechanism ."
selective redox regulation of cytokine receptor signaling by extracellular thioredoxin - 1 .,"the thiol - disulfide oxidoreductase thioredoxin - 1 ( trx1 ) is known to be secreted by leukocytes and to exhibit cytokine - like properties . extracellular effects of trx1 require a functional active site , suggesting a redox - based mechanism of action . however , specific cell surface proteins and pathways coupling extracellular trx1 redox activity to cellular responses have not been identified so far . using a mechanism - based kinetic trapping technique to identify disulfide exchange interactions on the intact surface of living lymphocytes , we found that trx1 catalytically interacts with a single principal target protein . this target protein was identified as the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 8 ( tnfrsf8 / cd30 ) . we demonstrate that the redox interaction is highly specific for both trx1 and cd30 and that the redox state of cd30 determines its ability to engage the cognate ligand and transduce signals . furthermore , we confirm that trx1 affects cd30 - dependent changes in lymphocyte effector function . thus , we conclude that receptor – ligand signaling interactions can be selectively regulated by an extracellular redox catalyst ."
screen for isg15 - crossreactive deubiquitinases .,"background : the family of ubiquitin - like molecules ( ubls ) comprises several members , each of which has sequence , structural , or functional similarity to ubiquitin . isg15 is a homolog of ubiquitin in vertebrates and is strongly upregulated following induction by type i interferon . isg15 can be covalently attached to proteins , analogous to ubiquitination and with actual support of ubiquitin conjugating factors . specific proteases are able to reverse modification with ubiquitin or ubls by hydrolyzing the covalent bond between their c - termini and substrate proteins . the tail regions of ubiquitin and isg15 are identical and we therefore hypothesized that promiscuous deubiquitinating proteases ( dubs ) might exist , capable of recognizing both ubiquitin and isg15 . results : we have cloned and expressed 22 human dubs , representing the major clades of the usp protease family . utilizing suicide inhibitors based on ubiquitin and isg15 , we have identified usp2 , usp5 ( isot1 ) , usp13 ( isot3 ) , and usp14 as isg15 - reactive proteases , in addition to the bona fide isg15 - specific protease usp18 ( ubp43 ) . usp14 is a proteasome - associated dub , and its isg15 isopeptidase activity increases when complexed with the proteasome . conclusions : by evolutionary standards , isg15 is a newcomer among the ubls and it apparently not only utilizes the conjugating but also the deconjugating machinery of its more established relative ubiquitin . functional overlap between these two posttranslational modifiers might therefore be more extensive than previously appreciated and explain the rather innocuous phenotype of isg15 null mice ."
s - rt - melt for rapid mutation scanning using enzymatic selection and real time dna - melting : new potential for multiplex genetic analysis .,"the rapidly growing understanding of human genetic pathways , including those that mediate cancer biology and drug response , leads to an increasing need for extensive and reliable mutation screening on a population or on a single patient basis . here we describe s - rt - melt , a novel technology that enables highly expanded enzymatic mutation scanning in human samples for germline or low - level somatic mutations , or for snp discovery . gc - clamp - containing pcr products from interrogated and wild - type samples are hybridized to generate mismatches at the positions of mutations over one or multiple sequences in - parallel . mismatches are converted to double - strand breaks using a dna endonuclease ( surveyor ™ ) and oligonucleotide tails are enzymatically attached at the position of mutations . a novel application of pcr enables selective amplification of mutation - containing dna fragments . subsequently , melting curve analysis , on conventional or nano - technology real - time pcr platforms , detects the samples that contain mutations in a high - throughput and closed - tube manner . we apply s - rt - melt in the screening of p53 and egfr mutations in cell lines and clinical samples and demonstrate its advantages for rapid , multiplexed mutation scanning in cancer and for genetic variation screening in biology and medicine ."
rapid identification of malaria vaccine candidates based on α - helical coiled coil protein motif .,"to identify malaria antigens for vaccine development , we selected α - helical coiled coil domains of proteins predicted to be present in the parasite erythrocytic stage . the corresponding synthetic peptides are expected to mimic structurally “ native ” epitopes . indeed the 95 chemically synthesized peptides were all specifically recognized by human immune sera , though at various prevalence . peptide specific antibodies were obtained both by affinity - purification from malaria immune sera and by immunization of mice . these antibodies did not show significant cross reactions , i.e. , they were specific for the original peptide , reacted with native parasite proteins in infected erythrocytes and several were active in inhibiting in vitro parasite growth . circular dichroism studies indicated that the selected peptides assumed partial or high α - helical content . thus , we demonstrate that the bioinformatics / chemical synthesis approach described here can lead to the rapid identification of molecules which target biologically active antibodies , thus identifying suitable vaccine candidates . this strategy can be , in principle , extended to vaccine discovery in a wide range of other pathogens ."
flugenome : a web tool for genotyping influenza a virus .,"influenza a viruses are hosted by numerous avian and mammalian species , which have shaped their evolution into distinct lineages worldwide . the viral genome consists of eight rna segments that are frequently exchanged between different viruses via a process known as genetic reassortment . a complete genotype nomenclature is essential to describe gene segment reassortment . specialized bioinformatic tools to analyze reassortment are not available , which hampers progress in understanding its role in host range , virulence and transmissibility of influenza viruses . to meet this need , we have developed a nomenclature to name influenza a genotypes and implemented a web server , flugenome ( http://www.flugenome.org/ ) , for the assignment of lineages and genotypes . flugenome provides functions for the user to interrogate the database in different modalities and get detailed reports on lineages and genotypes . these features make flugenome unique in its ability to automatically detect genotype differences attributable to reassortment events in influenza a virus evolution ."
influenza pandemic intervention planning using influsim : pharmaceutical and non - pharmaceutical interventions .,"background : influenza pandemic preparedness plans are currently developed and refined on national and international levels . much attention has been given to the administration of antiviral drugs , but contact reduction can also be an effective part of mitigation strategies and has the advantage to be not limited per se . the effectiveness of these interventions depends on various factors which must be explored by sensitivity analyses , based on mathematical models . methods : we use the freely available planning tool influsim to investigate how pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions can mitigate an influenza pandemic . in particular , we examine how intervention schedules , restricted stockpiles and contact reduction ( social distancing measures and isolation of cases ) determine the course of a pandemic wave and the success of interventions . results : a timely application of antiviral drugs combined with a quick implementation of contact reduction measures is required to substantially protract the peak of the epidemic and reduce its height . delays in the initiation of antiviral treatment ( e.g. because of parsimonious use of a limited stockpile ) result in much more pessimistic outcomes and can even lead to the paradoxical effect that the stockpile is depleted earlier compared to early distribution of antiviral drugs . conclusion : pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures should not be used exclusively . the protraction of the pandemic wave is essential to win time while waiting for vaccine development and production . however , it is the height of the peak of an epidemic which can easily overtax general practitioners , hospitals or even whole public health systems , causing bottlenecks in basic and emergency medical care ."
dna vaccines against protozoan parasites : advances and challenges .,"over the past 15 years , dna vaccines have gone from a scientific curiosity to one of the most dynamic research field and may offer new alternatives for the control of parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis and chagas disease . we review here some of the advances and challenges for the development of dna vaccines against these diseases . many studies have validated the concept of using dna vaccines for both protection and therapy against these protozoan parasites in a variety of mouse models . the challenge now is to translate what has been achieved in these models into veterinary or human vaccines of comparable efficacy . also , genome - mining and new antigen discovery strategies may provide new tools for a more rational search of novel vaccine candidates ."
estimating individual and household reproduction numbers in an emerging epidemic .,"reproduction numbers , defined as averages of the number of people infected by a typical case , play a central role in tracking infectious disease outbreaks . the aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak . i present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number , which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time , and discuss some potential benefits . then , to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics , i analyse a model of transmission within and between households , and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number , defined as the number of households infected by each infected household . this method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data , and estimates are obtained for would - be emerging epidemics of these viruses . i argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation , quarantine , vaccination or prophylactic treatment , and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between - household transmission , all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation ."
natural killer cells promote early cd8 t cell responses against cytomegalovirus .,"understanding the mechanisms that help promote protective immune responses to pathogens is a major challenge in biomedical research and an important goal for the design of innovative therapeutic or vaccination strategies . while natural killer ( nk ) cells can directly contribute to the control of viral replication , whether , and how , they may help orchestrate global antiviral defense is largely unknown . to address this question , we took advantage of the well - defined molecular interactions involved in the recognition of mouse cytomegalovirus ( mcmv ) by nk cells . by using congenic or mutant mice and wild - type versus genetically engineered viruses , we examined the consequences on antiviral cd8 t cell responses of specific defects in the ability of the nk cells to control mcmv . this system allowed us to demonstrate , to our knowledge for the first time , that nk cells accelerate cd8 t cell responses against a viral infection in vivo . moreover , we identify the underlying mechanism as the ability of nk cells to limit ifn - α / β production to levels not immunosuppressive to the host . this is achieved through the early control of cytomegalovirus , which dramatically reduces the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pdcs ) for cytokine production , preserves the conventional dendritic cell ( cdc ) compartment , and accelerates antiviral cd8 t cell responses . conversely , exogenous ifn - α administration in resistant animals ablates cdcs and delays cd8 t cell activation in the face of nk cell control of viral replication . collectively , our data demonstrate that the ability of nk cells to respond very early to cytomegalovirus infection critically contributes to balance the intensity of other innate immune responses , which dampens early immunopathology and promotes optimal initiation of antiviral cd8 t cell responses . thus , the extent to which nk cell responses benefit the host goes beyond their direct antiviral effects and extends to the prevention of innate cytokine shock and to the promotion of adaptive immunity ."
"the trojan chicken study , minnesota .",we conducted a study in the summer of 2004 at county fairs in the midwest to investigate the role poultry exhibits have in spreading avian pathogens to humans . a nearly invisible powder ( pathogen surrogate ) that fluoresces under uv light was surreptitiously sprinkled each day on 1 show bird at each of 2 fairs . a uv light box was used to daily examine the hands of 94 poultry - exhibit participants ( blinded regarding uv box results ) for up to 4 days during the poultry shows . enrollment and end - of - study questionnaires collected data on pathogen risk factors . eight ( 8.5 % ) of 94 participants had evidence of fluorescent powder contamination ( 95 % confidence interval 2.76 % – 14.26 % ) . this contamination and infrequent handwashing practices suggest that county fairs are a possible venue for animal - to - human pathogen transmission .
the restriction of zoonotic perv transmission by human apobec3g .,"the human apobec3g protein is an innate anti-viral factor that can dominantly inhibit the replication of some endogenous and exogenous retroviruses . the prospects of purposefully harnessing such an anti-viral defense are under investigation . here , long - term co-culture experiments were used to show that porcine endogenous retrovirus ( perv ) transmission from pig to human cells is reduced to nearly undetectable levels by expressing human apobec3g in virus - producing pig kidney cells . inhibition occurred by a deamination - independent mechanism , likely after particle production but before the virus could immortalize by integration into human genomic dna . perv inhibition did not require the dna cytosine deaminase activity of apobec3g and , correspondingly , apobec3g - attributable hypermutations were not detected . in contrast , over-expression of the sole endogenous apobec3 protein of pigs failed to interfere significantly with perv transmission . together , these data constitute the first proof - of - principle demonstration that apobec3 proteins can be used to fortify the innate anti-viral defenses of cells to prevent the zoonotic transmission of an endogenous retrovirus . these studies suggest that human apobec3g - transgenic pigs will provide safer , perv-less xenotransplantation resources and that analogous cross-species apobec3 - dependent restriction strategies may be useful for thwarting other endogenous as well as exogenous retrovirus infections ."
experimental infection of h5n1 hpai in balb / c mice .,"background : in 2005 huge epizooty of h5n1 hpai occurred in russia . it had been clear that territory of russia becoming endemic for h5n1 hpai . in 2006 several outbreaks have occurred . to develop new vaccines and antiviral therapies , animal models had to be investigated . we choose highly pathogenic strain for these studies . results : a / duck / tuva / 01/06 belongs to quinghai - like group viruses . molecular markers – cleavage site , k627 in pb2 characterize this virus as highly pathogenic . this data was confirmed by direct pathogenic tests : ivpi = 3.0 , mld ( 50 ) = 1,4 log10eid ( 50 ) . also molecular analysis showed sensivity of the virus to adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors . serological analysis showed wide cross-reactivity of this virus with sera produced to h5n1 hpai viruses isolated earlier in south - east asia . mean time to death of infected animals was 8,19 + / - 0,18 days . first time acute delayed hemorrhagic syndrome was observed in mice lethal model . hypercytokinemia was determined by elevated sera levels of ifn - gamma , il - 6 , il - 10 . conclusion : assuming all obtained data we can conclude that basic model parameters were characterized and virus a / duck / tuva / 01/06 can be used to evaluate anti-influenza vaccines and therapeutics ."
prediction of rna pseudoknots using heuristic modeling with mapping and sequential folding .,"predicting rna secondary structure is often the first step to determining the structure of rna . prediction approaches have historically avoided searching for pseudoknots because of the extreme combinatorial and time complexity of the problem . yet neglecting pseudoknots limits the utility of such approaches . here , an algorithm utilizing structure mapping and thermodynamics is introduced for rna pseudoknot prediction that finds the minimum free energy and identifies information about the flexibility of the rna . the heuristic approach takes advantage of the 5 ′ to 3 ′ folding direction of many biological rna molecules and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis and the contact order model . mapping methods are used to build and analyze the folded structure for pseudoknots and to add important 3d structural considerations . the program can predict some well known pseudoknot structures correctly . the results of this study suggest that many functional rna sequences are optimized for proper folding . they also suggest directions we can proceed in the future to achieve even better results ."
cell - penetrating peptides as transporters for morpholino oligomers : effects of amino acid composition on intracellular delivery and cytotoxicity .,"arginine - rich cell - penetrating peptides ( cpps ) are promising transporters for intracellular delivery of antisense morpholino oligomers ( pmo ) . here , we determined the effect of l - arginine , d - arginine and non-α amino acids on cellular uptake , splice - correction activity , cellular toxicity and serum binding for 24 cpp − pmos . insertion of 6 - aminohexanoic acid ( x ) or β - alanine ( b ) residues into oligoarginine r ( 8 ) decreased the cellular uptake but increased the splice - correction activity of the resulting compound , with a greater increase for the sequences containing more x residues . cellular toxicity was not observed for any of the conjugates up to 10 μm . up to 60 μm , only the conjugates with ⩾ 5 xs exhibited time - and concentration - dependent toxicity . substitution of l - arginine with d - arginine did not increase uptake or splice - correction activity . high concentration of serum significantly decreased the uptake and splice - correction activity of oligoarginine conjugates , but had much less effect on the conjugates containing x or b . in summary , incorporation of x / b into oligoarginine enhanced the antisense activity and serum - binding profile of cpp − pmo . toxicity of x / b - containing conjugates was affected by the number of xs , treatment time and concentration . more active , stable and less toxic cpps can be designed by optimizing the position and number of r , d - r , x and b residues ."
"lost in the world of functional genomics , systems biology , and translational research : is there life after the milstein award ?","we 've always wanted to save the world from the scourges of virus infection by developing better drugs and vaccines . but fully understanding the intricacies of virus - host interactions , the first step in achieving this goal , requires the ability to view the process on a grand scale . the advent of high - throughput technologies , such as dna microarrays and mass spectrometry , provided the first opportunities to obtain such a view . here we describe our efforts to use these tools to focus on the changes in cellular gene expression and protein abundance that occur in response to virus infection . by examining these changes in a comprehensive manner , we have been able to discover exciting new insights into innate immunity , interferon and cytokine signaling , and the strategies used by viruses to overcome these cellular defenses . functional genomics may yet save the world from killer viruses ."
electrospray ionisation - cleavable tandem nucleic acid mass tag – peptide nucleic acid conjugates : synthesis and applications to quantitative genomic analysis using electrospray ionisation - ms / ms .,"the synthesis and characterization of isotopomer tandem nucleic acid mass tag – peptide nucleic acid ( tnt – pna ) conjugates is described along with their use as electrospray ionisation - cleavable ( esi - cleavable ) hybridization probes for the detection and quantification of target dna sequences by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry ( esi - ms / ms ) . esi - cleavable peptide tnt isotopomers were introduced into pna oligonucleotide sequences in a total synthesis approach . these conjugates were evaluated as hybridization probes for the detection and quantification of immobilized synthetic target dnas using esi - ms / ms. in these experiments , the pna portion of the conjugate acts as a hybridization probe , whereas the peptide tnt is released in a collision - based process during the ionization of the probe conjugate in the electrospray ion source . the cleaved tnt acts as a uniquely resolvable marker to identify and quantify a unique target dna sequence . the method should be applicable to a wide variety of assays requiring highly multiplexed , quantitative dna / rna analysis , including gene expression monitoring , genetic profiling and the detection of pathogens ."
hairpin structure within the 3 ′ utr of dna polymerase β mrna acts as a post-transcriptional regulatory element and interacts with hax - 1 .,"aberrant expression of dna polymerase β , a key enzyme involved in base excision repair , leads to genetic instability and carcinogenesis . pol β expression has been previously shown to be regulated at the level of transcription , but there is also evidence of post-transcriptional regulation , since rat transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation , and the resulting 3 ′ utr contain at least one regulatory element . data presented here indicate that rna of the short 3 ′ utr folds to form a strong secondary structure ( hairpin ) . its regulatory role was established utilizing a luciferase - based reporter system . further studies led to the identification of a protein factor , which binds to this element — the anti-apoptotic , cytoskeleton - related protein hax - 1 . the results of in vitro binding analysis indicate that the formation of the rna – protein complex is significantly impaired by disruption of the hairpin motif . we demonstrate that hax - 1 binds to pol β mrna exclusively in the form of a dimer . biochemical analysis revealed the presence of hax - 1 in mitochondria , but also in the nuclear matrix , which , along with its transcript - binding properties , suggests that hax - 1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of expression of pol β ."
"global public goods and the global health agenda : problems , priorities and potential .","the ' global public good ' ( gpg ) concept has gained increasing attention , in health as well as development circles . however , it has suffered in finding currency as a general tool for global resource mobilisation , and is at risk of being attached to almost anything promoting development . this overstretches and devalues the validity and usefulness of the concept . this paper first defines gpgs and describes the policy challenge that they pose . second , it identifies two key areas , health r&d and communicable disease control , in which the gpg concept is clearly relevant and considers the extent to which it has been applied . we point out that that , while there have been many new initiatives , it is not clear that additional resources from non-traditional sources have been forthcoming . yet achieving this is , in effect , the entire purpose of applying the gpg concept in global health . moreover , the proliferation of disease - specific programs associated with gpg reasoning has tended to promote vertical interventions at the expense of more general health sector strengthening . third , we examine two major global health policy initiatives , the global fund against aids , tuberculosis and malaria ( gfatm ) and the bundling of long - standing international health goals in the form of millennium development goals ( mdg ) , asking how the gpg perspective has contributed to defining objectives and strategies . we conclude that both initiatives are best interpreted in the context of traditional development assistance and , one - world rhetoric aside , have little to do with the challenge posed by gpgs for health . the paper concludes by considering how the gpg concept can be more effectively used to promote global health ."
outcome of paediatric intensive care survivors .,"the development of paediatric intensive care has contributed to the improved survival of critically ill children . physical and psychological sequelae and consequences for quality of life ( qol ) in survivors might be significant , as has been determined in adult intensive care unit ( icu ) survivors . awareness of sequelae due to the original illness and its treatment may result in changes in treatment and support during and after the acute phase . to determine the current knowledge on physical and psychological sequelae and the quality of life in survivors of paediatric intensive care , we undertook a computerised comprehensive search of online databases for studies reporting sequelae in survivors of paediatric intensive care . studies reporting sequelae in paediatric survivors of cardiothoracic surgery and trauma were excluded , as were studies reporting only mortality . all other studies reporting aspects of physical and psychological sequelae were analysed . twenty - seven studies consisting of 3,444 survivors met the selection criteria . distinct physical and psychological sequelae in patients have been determined and seemed to interfere with quality of life . psychological sequelae in parents seem to be common . small numbers , methodological limitations and quantitative and qualitative heterogeneity hamper the interpretation of data . we conclude that paediatric intensive care survivors and their parents have physical and psychological sequelae affecting quality of life . further well - designed prospective studies evaluating sequelae of the original illness and its treatment are warranted ."
an evaluation of comparative genome sequencing ( cgs ) by comparing two previously - sequenced bacterial genomes .,"background : with the development of new technology , it has recently become practical to resequence the genome of a bacterium after experimental manipulation . it is critical though to know the accuracy of the technique used , and to establish confidence that all of the mutations were detected . results : in order to evaluate the accuracy of genome resequencing using the microarray - based comparative genome sequencing service provided by nimblegen systems inc. , we resequenced the e. coli strain w3110 kohara using mg1655 as a reference , both of which have been completely sequenced using traditional sequencing methods . cgs detected 7 of 8 small sequence differences , one large deletion , and 9 of 12 is element insertions present in w3110 , but did not detect a large chromosomal inversion . in addition , we confirmed that cgs also detected 2 snps , one deletion and 7 is element insertions that are not present in the genome sequence , which we attribute to changes that occurred after the creation of the w3110 lambda clone library . the false positive rate for snps was one per 244 kb of genome sequence . conclusion : cgs is an effective way to detect multiple mutations present in one bacterium relative to another , and while highly cost - effective , is prone to certain errors . mutations occurring in repeated sequences or in sequences with a high degree of secondary structure may go undetected . it is also critical to follow up on regions of interest in which snps were not called because they often indicate deletions or is element insertions ."

host gene expression profiling of dengue virus infection in cell lines and patients .,"background : despite the seriousness of dengue - related disease , with an estimated 50 – 100 million cases of dengue fever and 250,000 – 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever / dengue shock syndrome each year , a clear understanding of dengue pathogenesis remains elusive . because of the lack of a disease model in animals and the complex immune interaction in dengue infection , the study of host response and immunopathogenesis is difficult . the development of genomics technology , microarray and high throughput quantitative pcr have allowed researchers to study gene expression changes on a much broader scale . we therefore used this approach to investigate the host response in dengue virus - infected cell lines and in patients developing dengue fever . methodology / principal findings : using microarray and high throughput quantitative pcr method to monitor the host response to dengue viral replication in cell line infection models and in dengue patient blood samples , we identified differentially expressed genes along three major pathways ; nf - κb initiated immune responses , type i interferon ( ifn ) and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway . among the most highly upregulated genes were the chemokines ip - 10 and i - tac , both ligands of the cxcr3 receptor . increased expression of ip - 10 and i - tac in the peripheral blood of ten patients at the early onset of fever was confirmed by elisa . a highly upregulated gene in the ifn pathway , viperin , was overexpressed in a549 cells resulting in a significant reduction in viral replication . the upregulation of genes in the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway prompted the testing of proteasome inhibitors mg - 132 and alln , both of which reduced viral replication . conclusion / significance : unbiased gene expression analysis has identified new host genes associated with dengue infection , which we have validated in functional studies . we showed that some parts of the host response can be used as potential biomarkers for the disease while others can be used to control dengue viral replication , thus representing viable targets for drug therapy ."
species - specific evolution of immune receptor tyrosine based activation motif - containing ceacam1 - related immune receptors in the dog .,"background : although the impact of pathogens on the evolution of the mammalian immune system is still under debate , proteins , which both regulate immune responses and serve as cellular receptors for pathogens should be at the forefront of pathogen - driven host evolution . the cea ( carcinoembryonic antigen ) gene family codes for such proteins and indeed shows tremendous species - specific variation between human and rodents . since little is known about the cea gene family in other lineages of placental mammals , we expected to gain new insights into the evolution of the rapidly diverging cea family by analyzing the cea family of the dog . results : here we describe the complete cea gene family in the dog . we found that the gene coding for the itim - bearing immunoregulatory molecule ceacam1 gave rise to a recent expansion of the canine cea gene family by gene duplication , similar to that previously found in humans and mice . however , while the murine and human ceacams ( carcinoembryonic antigen - related cell adhesion molecules ) are predominantly secreted and gpi - anchored , respectively , in the dog , most of the ceacams represent itam - bearing transmembrane proteins . one of these proteins , ceacam28 , exhibits nearly complete sequence identity with the ligand - binding n domain of ceacam1 , but antagonizing signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic tail . comparison of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions indicates that the ceacam28 n domain is under the strongest purifying selection of all canine ceacam1 - related ceacams . in addition , ceacam28 shows a similar expression pattern in resting immune cells and tissues as ceacam1 . however , upon activation ceacam28 mrna and ceacam1 mrna are differentially regulated . conclusion : thus , ceacam1 and ceacam28 are the first paired immune receptors identified within the cea gene family , which are expressed on t cells and are most likely involved in the fine - tuning of t cell responses . the direction of gene conversion accompanied by purifying selection and expression in immune cells suggests the possibility that ceacam28 evolved in response to selective pressure imposed by species - specific pathogens ."
nucleolus : the fascinating nuclear body .,"nucleoli are the prominent contrasted structures of the cell nucleus . in the nucleolus , ribosomal rnas are synthesized , processed and assembled with ribosomal proteins . rna polymerase i synthesizes the ribosomal rnas and this activity is cell cycle regulated . the nucleolus reveals the functional organization of the nucleus in which the compartmentation of the different steps of ribosome biogenesis is observed whereas the nucleolar machineries are in permanent exchange with the nucleoplasm and other nuclear bodies . after mitosis , nucleolar assembly is a time and space regulated process controlled by the cell cycle . in addition , by generating a large volume in the nucleus with apparently no rna polymerase ii activity , the nucleolus creates a domain of retention / sequestration of molecules normally active outside the nucleolus . viruses interact with the nucleolus and recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus replication . the nucleolus is also a sensor of stress due to the redistribution of the ribosomal proteins in the nucleoplasm by nucleolus disruption . the nucleolus plays several crucial functions in the nucleus : in addition to its function as ribosome factory of the cells it is a multifunctional nuclear domain , and nucleolar activity is linked with several pathologies . perspectives on the evolution of this research area are proposed ."
antidiabetes and anti-obesity activity of lagerstroemia speciosa .,"the leaves of lagerstroemia speciosa ( lythraceae ) , a southeast asian tree more commonly known as banaba , have been traditionally consumed in various forms by philippinos for treatment of diabetes and kidney related diseases . in the 1990s , the popularity of this herbal medicine began to attract the attention of scientists worldwide . since then , researchers have conducted numerous in vitro and in vivo studies that consistently confirmed the antidiabetic activity of banaba . scientists have identified different components of banaba to be responsible for its activity . using tumor cells as a cell model , corosolic acid was isolated from the methanol extract of banaba and shown to be an active compound . more recently , a different cell model and the focus on the water soluble fraction of the extract led to the discovery of other compounds . the ellagitannin lagerstroemin was identified as an effective component of the banaba extract responsible for the activity . in a different approach , using 3t3 - l1 adipocytes as a cell model and a glucose uptake assay as the functional screening method , chen et al. showed that the banaba water extract exhibited an insulin - like glucose transport inducing activity . coupling hplc fractionation with a glucose uptake assay , gallotannins were identified in the banaba extract as components responsible for the activity , not corosolic acid . penta - o - galloyl - glucopyranose ( pgg ) was identified as the most potent gallotannin . a comparison of published data with results obtained for pgg indicates that pgg has a significantly higher glucose transport stimulatory activity than lagerstroemin . chen et al. have also shown that pgg exhibits anti-adipogenic properties in addition to stimulating the glucose uptake in adipocytes . the combination of glucose uptake and anti-adipogenesis activity is not found in the current insulin mimetic drugs and may indicate a great therapeutic potential of pgg ."
transmissibility of the influenza virus in the 1918 pandemic .,"background : with a heightened increase in concern for an influenza pandemic we sought to better understand the 1918 influenza pandemic , the most devastating epidemic of the previous century . methodology / principal findings : we use data from several communities in maryland , usa as well as two ships that experienced well - documented outbreaks of influenza in 1918 . using a likelihood - based method and a nonparametric method , we estimate the serial interval and reproductive number throughout the course of each outbreak . this analysis shows the basic reproductive number to be slightly lower in the maryland communities ( between 1.34 and 3.21 ) than for the enclosed populations on the ships ( r ( 0 ) = 4.97 , se = 3.31 ) . additionally the effective reproductive number declined to sub epidemic levels more quickly on the ships ( within around 10 days ) than in the communities ( within 30 – 40 days ) . the mean serial interval for the ships was consistent ( 3.33 , se = 5.96 and 3.81 , se = 3.69 ) , while the serial intervals in the communities varied substantially ( between 2.83 , se = 0.53 and 8.28 , se = 951.95 ) . conclusions / significance : these results illustrate the importance of considering the population dynamics when making statements about the epidemiological parameters of influenza . the methods that we employ for estimation of the reproductive numbers and the serial interval can be easily replicated in other populations and with other diseases ."
surfactant therapy for acute respiratory failure in children : a systematic review and meta - analysis .,"introduction : exogenous surfactant is used to treat acute respiratory failure in children , although the benefits and harms in this setting are not clear . the objective of the present systematic review is to assess the effect of exogenous pulmonary surfactant on all - cause mortality in children mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure . methods : we searched the medline , embase , cinahl and ovid healthstar databases , the bibliographies of included trials and review articles , conference proceedings and trial registries . we included prospective , randomized , controlled trials of pulmonary surfactant that enrolled intubated and mechanically ventilated children with acute respiratory failure . we excluded trials that exclusively enrolled neonates or patients with asthma . two reviewers independently rated trials for inclusion , extracted data and assessed the methodologic quality . we quantitatively pooled the results of trials , where suitable , using a random effects model . results : six trials randomizing 314 patients were included . surfactant use reduced mortality ( relative risk = 0.7 , 95 % confidence interval = 0.4 to 0.97 , p = 0.04 ) , was associated with increased ventilator - free days ( weighted mean difference = 2.5 days , 95 % confidence interval = 0.3 to 4.6 days , p = 0.02 ) and reduced the duration of ventilation ( weighted mean difference = 2.3 days , 95 % confidence interval = 0.1 to 4.4 days , p = 0.04 ) . conclusion : surfactant use decreased mortality , was associated with more ventilator - free days and reduced the duration of ventilation . no serious adverse events were reported ."
clinical review : update of avian influenza a infections in humans .,"influenza a viruses have a wide host range for infection , from wild waterfowl to poultry to humans . recently , the cross-species transmission of avian influenza a , particularly subtype h5n1 , has highlighted the importance of the non-human subtypes and their incidence in the human population has increased over the past decade . during cross-species transmission , human disease can range from the asymptomatic to mild conjunctivitis to fulminant pneumonia and death . with these cases , however , the risk for genetic change and development of a novel virus increases , heightening the need for public health and hospital measures . this review discusses the epidemiology , host range , human disease , outcome , treatment , and prevention of cross-transmission of avian influenza a into humans ."
clinical review : mass casualty triage – pandemic influenza and critical care .,"worst case scenarios for pandemic influenza planning in the us involve over 700,000 patients requiring mechanical ventilation . uk planning predicts a 231 % occupancy of current level 3 ( intensive care unit ) bed capacity . critical care planners need to recognise that mortality is likely to be high and the risk to healthcare workers significant . contingency planning should , therefore , be multi-faceted , involving a robust health command structure , the facility to expand critical care provision in terms of space , equipment and staff and cohorting of affected patients in the early stages . it should also be recognised that despite this expansion of critical care , demand will exceed supply and a process for triage needs to be developed that is valid , reproducible , transparent and consistent with distributive justice . we advocate the development and validation of physiological scores for use as a triage tool , coupled with candid public discussion of the process ."
avian influenza outbreak in turkey through health personnel 's views : a qualitative study .,"background : avian influenza threatens public health worldwide because it is usually associated with severe illness and , consequently , a higher risk of death . during the first months of 2006 , turkey experienced its first human avian influenza epidemic . a total of 21 human cases were identified , 12 of which were confirmed by the national institute for medical research . nine of the cases , including the four fatal ones , were from the dogubeyazit - van region . this study aims to evaluate the efforts at the avian influenza outbreak control in the van - dogubeyazit region in 2006 through the experiences of health personnel . methods : we conducted in - depth interviews with seventeen key informants who took active roles during the avian influenza outbreak in east turkey during the first months of 2006 . we gathered information about the initial responses , the progress and management of the outbreak control , and the reactions of the health professionals and the public . the findings of the study are reported according to the topics that appeared through thematic analysis of the interview transcripts . results : following the first suspected avian influenza cases , a van crisis coordination committee was formed as the coordinating and decision - making body and played an important role in the appropriate timing of decisions . the health and agriculture services could not be well coordinated owing to the lack of integrated planning in preparation for outbreak and of integrated surveillance programs . traditional poultry practice together with the low socio - economic status of the people and the lack of health care access in the region seemed to be a major risk for animal to animal and animal to human transmission . the strengths and weaknesses of the present health system – primary health care services , national surveillance and notification systems , human resource and management – affected the inter organizational coordination during the outbreak . open communication between the government and the public played an important part in overcoming difficulties . conclusion : although there were problems during the avian influenza outbreak in turkey , the rapid responses of the central and regional health authorities and the performance of the health workers were the key points in controlling the epidemic . the lessons from this outbreak should provide an opportunity for integrating the preparation plans of the health and agricultural organizations , and for revising the surveillance system and enhancing the role of the primary health care services in controlling epidemic disease . developing successful strategies based on knowledge and experience may play a valuable role in delaying an avian influenza pandemic ."
"influenza activity in europe during eight seasons ( 1999 – 2007 ) : an evaluation of the indicators used to measure activity and an assessment of the timing , length and course of peak activity ( spread ) across europe .","background : the european influenza surveillance scheme ( eiss ) has collected clinical and virological data on influenza since 1996 in an increasing number of countries . the eiss dataset was used to characterise important epidemiological features of influenza activity in europe during eight winters ( 1999 – 2007 ) . the following questions were addressed : 1 ) are the sentinel clinical reports a good measure of influenza activity ? 2 ) how long is a typical influenza season in europe ? 3 ) is there a west - east and / or south - north course of peak activity ( ' spread ' ) of influenza in europe ? methods : influenza activity was measured by collecting data from sentinel general practitioners ( gps ) and reports by national reference laboratories . the sentinel reports were first evaluated by comparing them to the laboratory reports and were then used to assess the timing and spread of influenza activity across europe during eight seasons . results : we found a good match between the clinical sentinel data and laboratory reports of influenza collected by sentinel physicians ( overall match of 72 % for + / - 1 week difference ) . we also found a moderate to good match between the clinical sentinel data and laboratory reports of influenza from non-sentinel sources ( overall match of 60 % for + / - 1 week ) . there were no statistically significant differences between countries using ili ( influenza - like illness ) or ari ( acute respiratory disease ) as case definition . when looking at the peak - weeks of clinical activity , the average length of an influenza season in europe was 15.6 weeks ( median 15 weeks ; range 12 – 19 weeks ) . plotting the peak weeks of clinical influenza activity reported by sentinel gps against the longitude or latitude of each country indicated that there was a west - east spread of peak activity ( spread ) of influenza across europe in four winters ( 2001 – 2002 , 2002 – 2003 , 2003 – 2004 and 2004 – 2005 ) and a south - north spread in three winters ( 2001 – 2002 , 2004 – 2005 and 2006 – 2007 ) . conclusion : we found that : 1 ) the clinical data reported by sentinel physicians is a valid indicator of influenza activity ; 2 ) the length of influenza activity across the whole of europe was surprisingly long , ranging from 12 – 19 weeks ; 3 ) in 4 out of the 8 seasons , there was a west - east spread of influenza , in 3 seasons a south - north spread ; not associated with type of dominant virus in those seasons ."

simian virus 40 vectors for pulmonary gene therapy .,"background : sepsis remains the leading cause of death in critically ill patients . one of the primary organs affected by sepsis is the lung , presenting as the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) . organ damage in sepsis involves an alteration in gene expression , making gene transfer a potential therapeutic modality . this work examines the feasibility of applying simian virus 40 ( sv40 ) vectors for pulmonary gene therapy . methods : sepsis - induced ards was established by cecal ligation double puncture ( 2clp ) . sv40 vectors carrying the luciferase reporter gene ( sv / luc ) were administered intratracheally immediately after sepsis induction . sham operated ( so ) as well as 2clp rats given intratracheal pbs or adenovirus expressing luciferase served as controls . luc transduction was evaluated by in vivo light detection , immunoassay and luciferase mrna detection by rt - pcr in tissue harvested from septic rats . vector abundance and distribution into alveolar cells was evaluated using immunostaining for the sv40 vp1 capsid protein as well as by double staining for vp1 and for the surfactant protein c ( prosp - c ) . immunostaining for t - lymphocytes was used to evaluate the cellular immune response induced by the vector . results : luc expression measured by in vivo light detection correlated with immunoassay from lung tissue harvested from the same rats . moreover , our results showed vector presence in type ii alveolar cells . the vector did not induce significant cellular immune response . conclusion : in the present study we have demonstrated efficient uptake and expression of an sv40 vector in the lungs of animals with sepsis - induced ards . these vectors appear to be capable of in vivo transduction of alveolar type ii cells and may thus become a future therapeutic tool ."
role of receptor polymorphism and glycosylation in syncytium induction and host range variation of ecotropic mouse gammaretroviruses .,"background : we previously identified unusual variants of moloney and friend ecotropic mouse gammaretroviruses that have altered host range and are cytopathic in cells of the wild mouse species mus dunni . cytopathicity was attributed to different amino acid substitutions at the same critical env residue involved in receptor interaction : s82f in the moloney variant spl574 , and s84a in the friend mouse leukemia virus f - s mlv . because m. dunni cells carry a variant cat - 1 cell surface virus receptor ( dcat - 1 ) , we examined the role of this receptor variant in cytopathicity and host range . results : we expressed dcat - 1 or mcat - 1 of nih 3t3 origin in cells that are not normally infectible with ecotropic mlvs and evaluated the transfectants for susceptibility to virus infection and to virus - induced syncytium formation . the dcat - 1 transfectants , but not the mcat - 1 transfectants , were susceptible to virus - induced cytopathicity , and this cytopathic response was accompanied by the accumulation of unintegrated viral dna . the dcat - 1 transfectants , however , did not also reproduce the relative resistance of m. dunni cells to moloney mlv , and the mcat - 1 transfectants did not show the relative resistance of nih 3t3 cells to spl574 . western analysis , use of glycosylation inhibitors and mutagenesis to remove receptor glycosylation sites identified a possible role for cell - specific glycosylation in the modulation of virus entry . conclusion : virus entry and virus - induced syncytium formation using the cat - 1 receptor are mediated by a small number of critical amino acid residues in receptor and virus env . virus entry is modulated by glycosylation of cellular proteins , and this effect is cell and virus - specific ."
the presence of the tar rna structure alters the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift efficiency of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( hiv - 1 ) by modifying the rate of translation initiation .,"hiv - 1 uses a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift to synthesize the precursor of its enzymes , gag - pol . the frameshift efficiency that is critical for the virus replication , is controlled by an interaction between the ribosome and a specific structure on the viral mrna , the frameshift stimulatory signal . the rate of cap - dependent translation initiation is known to be altered by the tar rna structure , present at the 5 ′ and 3 ′ end of all hiv - 1 mrnas . depending upon its concentration , tar activates or inhibits the double - stranded rna - dependent protein kinase ( pkr ) . we investigated here whether changes in translation initiation caused by tar affect hiv - 1 frameshift efficiency . cd4 + t cells and 293t cells were transfected with a dual - luciferase construct where the firefly luciferase expression depends upon the hiv - 1 frameshift . translation initiation was altered by adding tar in cis or trans of the reporter mrna . we show that hiv - 1 frameshift efficiency correlates negatively with changes in the rate of translation initiation caused by tar and mediated by pkr . a model is presented where changes in the rate of initiation affect the probability of frameshifting by altering the distance between elongating ribosomes on the mrna , which influences the frequency of encounter between these ribosomes and the frameshift stimulatory signal ."
establishing a nationwide emergency department - based syndromic surveillance system for better public health responses in taiwan .,"background : with international concern over emerging infectious diseases ( eid ) and bioterrorist attacks , public health is being required to have early outbreak detection systems . a disease surveillance team was organized to establish a hospital emergency department - based syndromic surveillance system ( ed - sss ) capable of automatically transmitting patient data electronically from the hospitals responsible for emergency care throughout the country to the centers for disease control in taiwan ( taiwan - cdc ) starting march , 2004 . this report describes the challenges and steps involved in developing ed - sss and the timely information it provides to improve in public health decision - making . methods : between june 2003 and march 2004 , after comparing various surveillance systems used around the world and consulting with ed physicians , pediatricians and internal medicine physicians involved in infectious disease control , the syndromic surveillance research team in taiwan worked with the real - time outbreak and disease surveillance ( rods ) laboratory at the university of pittsburgh to create taiwan 's ed - sss . the system was evaluated by analyzing daily electronic ed data received in real - time from the 189 hospitals participating in this system between april 1 , 2004 and march 31 , 2005 . results : taiwan 's ed - sss identified winter and summer spikes in two syndrome groups : influenza - like illnesses and respiratory syndrome illnesses , while total numbers of ed visits were significantly higher on weekends , national holidays and the days of chinese lunar new year than weekdays ( p < 0.001 ) . it also identified increases in the upper , lower , and total gastrointestinal ( gi ) syndrome groups starting in november 2004 and two clear spikes in enterovirus - like infections coinciding with the two school semesters . using ed - sss for surveillance of influenza - like illnesses and enteroviruses - related infections has improved taiwan 's pandemic flu preparedness and disease control capabilities . conclusion : taiwan 's ed - sss represents the first nationwide real - time syndromic surveillance system ever established in asia . the experiences reported herein can encourage other countries to develop their own surveillance systems . the system can be adapted to other cultural and language environments for better global surveillance of infectious diseases and international collaboration ."
amino acid similarity accounts for t cell cross-reactivity and for “ holes ” in the t cell repertoire .,"background : cytotoxic t cell ( ctl ) cross-reactivity is believed to play a pivotal role in generating immune responses but the extent and mechanisms of ctl cross-reactivity remain largely unknown . several studies suggest that ctl clones can recognize highly diverse peptides , some sharing no obvious sequence identity . the emerging realization in the field is that t cell receptors ( tcr ) recognize multiple distinct ligands . principal findings : first , we analyzed peptide scans of the hiv epitope slfntvatl ( sfl9 ) and found that tcr specificity is position dependent and that biochemically similar amino acid substitutions do not drastically affect recognition . inspired by this , we developed a general model of tcr peptide recognition using amino acid similarity matrices and found that such a model was able to predict the cross-reactivity of a diverse set of ctl epitopes . with this model , we were able to demonstrate that seemingly distinct t cell epitopes , i.e. , ones with low sequence identity , are in fact more biochemically similar than expected . additionally , an analysis of hiv immunogenicity data with our model showed that ctls have the tendency to respond mostly to peptides that do not resemble self - antigens . conclusions : t cell cross-reactivity can thus , to an extent greater than earlier appreciated , be explained by amino acid similarity . the results presented in this paper will help resolving some of the long - lasting discussions in the field of t cell cross-reactivity ."
"distinguishing molecular features and clinical characteristics of a putative new rhinovirus species , human rhinovirus c ( hrv c )","background : human rhinoviruses ( hrvs ) are the most frequently detected pathogens in acute respiratory tract infections ( artis ) and yet little is known about the prevalence , recurrence , structure and clinical impact of individual members . during 2007 , the complete coding sequences of six previously unknown and highly divergent hrv strains were reported . to catalogue the molecular and clinical features distinguishing the divergent hrv strains , we undertook , for the first time , in silico analyses of all available polyprotein sequences and performed retrospective reviews of the medical records of cases in which variants of the prototype strain , hrv - qpm , had been detected . methodology / principle findings : genomic analyses revealed that the six divergent strains , residing within a clade we previously called hrv a2 , had the shortest polyprotein of all picornaviruses investigated . structure - based amino acid alignments identified conserved motifs shared among members of the genus rhinovirus as well as substantive deletions and insertions unique to the divergent strains . deletions mostly affected regions encoding proteins traditionally involved in antigenicity and serving as hrv and hev receptor footprints . because the hrv a2 strains can not yet be cultured , we created homology models of predicted hrv - qpm structural proteins . in silico comparisons confirmed that hrv - qpm was most closely related to the major group hrvs . hrv - qpm was most frequently detected in infants with expiratory wheezing or persistent cough who had been admitted to hospital and required supplemental oxygen . it was the only virus detected in 65 % of positive individuals . these observations contributed to an objective clinical impact ranging from mild to severe . conclusions : the divergent strains did not meet classification requirements for any existing species of the genus rhinovirus or enterovirus . hrv a2 strains should be partitioned into at least one new species , putatively called human rhinovirus c , populated by members detected with high frequency , from individuals with respiratory symptoms requiring hospital admission ."
epithelial cell apoptosis and neutrophil recruitment in acute lung injury — a unifying hypothesis ? what we have learned from small interfering rnas .,"in spite of protective ventilatory strategies , acute lung injury ( ali ) remains associated with high morbidity and mortality . one reason for the lack of therapeutic options might be that ali is a co-morbid event associated with a diverse family of diseases and , thus , may be the result of distinct pathological processes . among them , activated neutrophil - ( pmn - ) induced tissue injury and epithelial cell apoptosis mediated lung damage represent two potentially important candidate pathomechanisms that have been put forward . several approaches have been undertaken to test these hypotheses , with substantial success in the treatment of experimental forms of ali . with this in mind , we will summarize these two current hypotheses of ali briefly , emphasizing the role of apoptosis in regulating pmn and / or lung epithelial cell responses . in addition , the contribution that fas - mediated inflammation may play as a potential biological link between lung cell apoptosis and pmn recruitment will be considered , as well as the in vivo application of small interfering rna ( sirna ) as a novel approach to the inhibition of ali and its therapeutic implications ."
"the cucumovirus 2b gene drives selection of inter-viral recombinants affecting the crossover site , the acceptor rna and the rate of selection .","rna – rna recombination is an important pathway in virus evolution and has been described for many viruses . however , the factors driving recombination or promoting the selection of recombinants are still unclear . here , we show that the small movement protein ( 2b ) was able to promote selection of rna 1/2 – rna 3 recombinants within a chimeric virus having rnas 1 and 2 from cucumber mosaic virus , and rna 3 from the related tomato aspermy virus , along with heterologous 2b genes . the source of the 2b also determined the selection of the acceptor rna and the crossover site , as well as affecting the rate of selection of the recombinant rnas . the nature of the rna 3 also influenced the selection of the recombinant rnas . a 163 - nt tandem repeat in rna 3 significantly affected the rate of selection of the recombinant rna , while a single nucleotide within the repeat affected the crossover site . the recombination occurred in a non-random manner , involved no intermediates and probably was generated via a copy - choice mechanism during ( + ) strand rna synthesis ."
epigrass : a tool to study disease spread in complex networks .,"background : the construction of complex spatial simulation models such as those used in network epidemiology , is a daunting task due to the large amount of data involved in their parameterization . such data , which frequently resides on large geo - referenced databases , has to be processed and assigned to the various components of the model . all this just to construct the model , then it still has to be simulated and analyzed under different epidemiological scenarios . this workflow can only be achieved efficiently by computational tools that can automate most , if not all , these time - consuming tasks . in this paper , we present a simulation software , epigrass , aimed to help designing and simulating network - epidemic models with any kind of node behavior . results : a network epidemiological model representing the spread of a directly transmitted disease through a bus - transportation network connecting mid-size cities in brazil . results show that the topological context of the starting point of the epidemic is of great importance from both control and preventive perspectives . conclusion : epigrass is shown to facilitate greatly the construction , simulation and analysis of complex network models . the output of model results in standard gis file formats facilitate the post-processing and analysis of results by means of sophisticated gis software ."
autoimmune cholangitis in the sjl / j mouse is antigen non-specific .,"primary biliary cirrhosis ( pbc ) is an autoimmune disease characterized by intrahepatic bile duct destruction and the production of anti-mitochondrial antibodies ( ama ) . the absence of an animal model has been a striking impedance in defining the molecular basis of disease . previous work has suggested that sjl / j mice immunize with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( pdc - e2 ) , the major mitochondrial autoantigen of pbc , leads to the development of lymphoid cell infiltration in portal tracts and a model system coined autoimmune cholangitis . we hypothesized that this pathology would be augmented if immunization occurred in the presence of ifn - γ injections . accordingly , sjl / j mice were immunized with pdc - e2 and , for purpose of control , α - casein . subgroups of mice were also treated with exogenous ifn - γ . as expected , mice immunized with pdc - e2 , with or without ifn - γ , developed high titer amas . in contrast , mice immunized with α - casein , develop antinuclear antibodies . more importantly , the livers from mice immunized with pdc - e2 and / or those immunized with α - casein all displayed lymphoid cell infiltration to the portal tracts , irrespective of bile duct size . indeed , there was no significant difference between the experimental and the control groups by histologic analysis . thus , autoimmune cholangitis in these mice is antigen non-specific ."
"la crosse virus infectivity , pathogenesis , and immunogenicity in mice and monkeys .","background : la crosse virus ( lacv ) , family bunyaviridae , was first identified as a human pathogen in 1960 after its isolation from a 4 year - old girl with fatal encephalitis in la crosse , wisconsin . lacv is a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in north america and infects up to 300,000 persons each year of which 70 – 130 result in severe disease of the central nervous system ( cns ) . as an initial step in the establishment of useful animal models to support vaccine development , we examined lacv infectivity , pathogenesis , and immunogenicity in both weanling mice and rhesus monkeys . results : following intraperitoneal inoculation of mice , lacv replicated in various organs before reaching the cns where it replicates to high titer causing death from neurological disease . the peripheral site where lacv replicates to highest titer is the nasal turbinates , and , presumably , lacv can enter the cns via the olfactory neurons from nasal olfactory epithelium . the mouse infectious dose ( 50 ) and lethal dose ( 50 ) was similar for lacv administered either intranasally or intraperitoneally . lacv was highly infectious for rhesus monkeys and infected 100 % of the animals at 10 pfu . however , the infection was asymptomatic , and the monkeys developed a strong neutralizing antibody response . conclusion : in mice , lacv likely gains access to the cns via the blood stream or via olfactory neurons . the ability to efficiently infect mice intranasally raises the possibility that lacv might use this route to infect its natural hosts . rhesus monkeys are susceptible to lacv infection and develop strong neutralizing antibody responses after inoculation with as little as 10 pfu . mice and rhesus monkeys are useful animal models for lacv vaccine immunologic testing although the rhesus monkey model is not optimal ."
the intrinsically disordered c ‐ terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein interacts with the c ‐ terminal domain of the phosphoprotein via two distinct sites and remains predominantly unfolded .,"measles virus is a negative ‐ sense , single ‐ stranded rna virus within themononegavirales order , which includes several human pathogens , including rabies , ebola , nipah , and hendra viruses . themeasles virus nucleoprotein consists of a structured n ‐ terminal domain , and of an intrinsically disordered c ‐ terminal domain , n ( tail ) ( aa 401 – 525 ) , which undergoes induced folding in the presence of the c ‐ terminal domain ( xd , aa 459 – 507 ) of the viral phosphoprotein . with in n ( tail ) , an α ‐ helical molecular recognition element ( α ‐ more , aa 488 – 499 ) involved in binding to p and in induced folding was identified and then observed in the crystal structure of xd . using small ‐ angle x ‐ ray scattering , we have derived a low ‐ resolution structural model of the complex between xd and n ( tail ) , which shows that most of n ( tail ) remains disordered in the complex despite p ‐ induced folding within the α ‐ more . the model consists of an extended shape accommodating the multiple conformations adopted by the disordered n ‐ terminal region of n ( tail ) , and of a bulky globular region , corresponding to xd and to the c terminus of n ( tail ) ( aa 486 – 525 ) . using surface plasmon resonance , circular dichroism , fluorescence spectroscopy , and heteronuclear magnetic resonance , we show that n ( tail ) has an additional site ( aa 517 – 525 ) involved in binding to xd but not in the unstructured ‐ to ‐ structured transition . this work provides evidence that intrinsically disordered domains can establish complex interactions with their partners , and can contact them through multiple sites that do not all necessarily gain regular secondary structure ."
"a survey of knowledge , attitudes and practices towards avian influenza in an adult population of italy .","background : several public health strategic interventions are required for effective prevention and control of avian influenza ( ai ) and it is necessary to create a communication plan to keep families adequately informed on how to avoid or reduce exposure . this investigation determined the knowledge , attitudes , and behaviors relating to ai among an adult population in italy . methods : from december 2005 to february 2006 a random sample of 1020 adults received a questionnaire about socio - demographic characteristics , knowledge of transmission and prevention about ai , attitudes towards ai , behaviors regarding use of preventive measures and food - handling practices , and sources of information about ai . results : a response rate of 67 % was achieved . those in higher socioeconomic classes were more likely to identify the modes of transmission and the animals ' vehicles for ai . those older , who knew the modes of transmission and the animals ' vehicles for ai , and who still need information , were more likely to know that washing hands soap before and after touching raw poultry meat and using gloves is recommended to avoid spreading of ai through food . the risk of being infected was significantly higher in those from lower socioeconomic classes , if they did not know the definition of ai , if they knew that ai could be transmitted by eating and touching raw eggs and poultry foods , and if they did not need information . compliance with the hygienic practices during handling of raw poultry meat was more likely in those who perceived to be at higher risk , who knew the hygienic practices , who knew the modes of transmission and the animals ' vehicles for ai , and who received information from health professionals and scientific journals . conclusion : respondents demonstrate no detailed understanding of ai , a greater perceived risk , and a lower compliance with precautions behaviors and health educational strategies are strongly needed ."
the evolution of human influenza a viruses from 1999 to 2006 : a complete genome study .,"background : knowledge about the complete genome constellation of seasonal influenza a viruses from different countries is valuable for monitoring and understanding of the evolution and migration of strains . few complete genome sequences of influenza a viruses from europe are publicly available at the present time and there have been few longitudinal genome studies of human influenza a viruses . we have studied the evolution of circulating human h3n2 , h1n1 and h1n2 influenza a viruses from 1999 to 2006 , we analysed 234 danish human influenza a viruses and characterised 24 complete genomes . results : h3n2 was the prevalent strain in denmark during the study period , but h1n1 dominated the 2000 – 2001 season . h1n2 viruses were first observed in denmark in 2002 – 2003 . after years of little genetic change in the h1n1 viruses the 2005 – 2006 season presented h1n1 of greater variability than before . this indicates that h1n1 viruses are evolving and that h1n1 soon is likely to be the prevalent strain again . generally , the influenza a haemagglutinin ( ha ) of h3n2 viruses formed seasonal phylogenetic clusters . different lineages co-circulating within the same season were also observed . the evolution has been stochastic , influenced by small "" jumps "" in genetic distance rather than constant drift , especially with the introduction of the fujian - like viruses in 2002 – 2003 . also evolutionary stasis - periods were observed which might indicate well fit viruses . the evolution of h3n2 viruses have also been influenced by gene reassortments between lineages from different seasons . none of the influenza genes were influenced by strong positive selection pressure . the antigenic site b in h3n2 ha was the preferred site for genetic change during the study period probably because the site a has been masked by glycosylations . substitutions at ctl - epitopes in the genes coding for the neuraminidase ( na ) , polymerase acidic protein ( pa ) , matrix protein 1 ( m1 ) , non-structural protein 1 ( ns1 ) and especially the nucleoprotein ( np ) were observed . the n - linked glycosylation pattern varied during the study period and the h3n2 isolates from 2004 to 2006 were highly glycosylated with ten predicted sequons in ha , the highest amount of glycosylations observed in this study period . conclusion : the present study is the first to our knowledge to characterise the evolution of complete genomes of influenza a h3n2 , h1n1 and h1n2 isolates from europe over a time period of seven years from 1999 to 2006 . more precise knowledge about the circulating strains may have implications for predicting the following season strains and thereby better matching the vaccine composition ."
"can "" presumed consent "" justify the duty to treat infectious diseases ? an analysis .","background : aids , sars , and the recent epidemics of the avian - flu have all served to remind us the debate over the limits of the moral duty to care . it is important to first consider the question of whether or not the "" duty to treat "" might be subject to contextual constraints . the purpose of this study was to investigate the opinions and beliefs held by both physicians and dentists regarding the occupational risks of infectious diseases , and to analyze the argument that the notion of "" presumed consent "" on the part of professionals may be grounds for supporting the duty to treat . methods : for this cross-sectional survey , the study population was selected from among physicians and dentists in ankara . all of the 373 participants were given a self - administered questionnaire . results : in total , 79.6 % of the participants said that they either had some degree of knowledge about the risks when they chose their profession or that they learned of the risks later during their education and training . of the participants , 5.2 % said that they would not have chosen this profession if they had been informed of the risks . it was found that 57 % of the participants believed that there is a standard level of risk , and 52 % of the participants stated that certain diseases would exceed the level of acceptable risk unless specific protective measures were implemented . conclusion : if we use the presumed consent argument to establish the duty of the hcw to provide care , we are confronted with problems ranging over the difficulty of choosing a profession autonomously , the constant level of uncertainty present in the medical profession , the near - impossibility of being able to evaluate retrospectively whether every individual was informed , and the seemingly inescapable problem that this practice would legitimize , and perhaps even foster , discrimination against patients with certain diseases . our findings suggest that another problem can be added to the list : one - fifth of the participants in this study either lacked adequate knowledge of the occupational risks when they chose the medical profession or were not sufficiently informed of these risks during their faculty education and training . furthermore , in terms of the moral duty to provide care , it seems that most hcws are more concerned about the availability of protective measures than about whether they had been informed of a particular risk beforehand . for all these reasons , the presumed consent argument is not persuasive enough , and can not be used to justify the duty to provide care . it is therefore more useful to emphasize justifications other than presumed consent when defining the duty of hcws to provide care , such as the social contract between society and the medical profession and the fact that hcws have a greater ability to provide medical aid ."
improved production of human type ii procollagen in the yeast pichia pastoris in shake flasks by a wireless - controlled fed - batch system .,"background : here we describe a new technical solution for optimization of pichia pastoris shake flask cultures with the example of production of stable human type ii collagen . production of recombinant proteins in p. pastoris is usually performed by controlling gene expression with the strong aox1 promoter , which is induced by addition of methanol . optimization of processes using the aox1 promoter in p. pastoris is generally done in bioreactors by fed - batch fermentation with a controlled continuous addition of methanol for avoiding methanol toxification and carbon / energy starvation . the development of feeding protocols and the study of aox1 - controlled recombinant protein production have been largely made in shake flasks , although shake flasks have very limited possibilities for measurement and control . results : by applying on - line po ( 2 ) monitoring we demonstrate that the widely used pulse feeding of methanol results in long phases of methanol exhaustion and consequently low expression of aox1 controlled genes . furthermore , we provide a solution to apply the fed - batch strategy in shake flasks . the presented solution applies a wireless feeding unit which can be flexibly positioned and allows the use of computer - controlled feeding profiles . by using the human collagen ii as an example we show that a quasi-continuous feeding profile , being the simplest way of a fed - batch fermentation , results in a higher production level of human collagen ii . moreover , the product has a higher proteolytic stability compared to control cultures due to the increased expression of human collagen prolyl 4 - hydroxylase as monitored by mrna and protein levels . conclusion : the recommended standard protocol for methanol addition in shake flasks using pulse feeding is non-optimal and leads to repeated long phases of methanol starvation . the problem can be solved by applying the fed - batch technology . the presented wireless feeding unit , together with an on - line monitoring system offers a flexible , simple , and low - cost solution for initial optimization of the production in shake flasks which can be performed in parallel . by this way the fed - batch strategy can be applied from the early screening steps also in laboratories which do not have access to high - cost and complicated bioreactor systems ."
hmgb1 : endogenous danger signaling .,"while foreign pathogens and their products have long been known to activate the innate immune system , the recent recognition of a group of endogenous molecules that serve a similar function has provided a framework for understanding the overlap between the inflammatory responses activated by pathogens and injury . these endogenous molecules , termed alarmins , are normal cell constituents that can be released into the extracellular milieu during states of cellular stress or damage and subsequently activate the immune system . one nuclear protein , high mobility group box - 1 ( hmgb1 ) , has received particular attention as fulfilling the functions of an alarmin by being involved in both infectious and non-infectious inflammatory conditions . once released , hmgb1 signals through various receptors to activate immune cells involved in the immune process . although initial studies demonstrated hmgb1 as a late mediator of sepsis , recent findings indicate hmgb1 to have an important role in models of non-infectious inflammation , such as autoimmunity , cancer , trauma , and ischemia reperfusion injury . furthermore , in contrast to its pro-inflammatory functions , there is evidence that hmgb1 also has restorative effects leading to tissue repair and regeneration . the complex functions of hmgb1 as an archetypical alarmin are outlined here to review our current understanding of a molecule that holds the potential for treatment in many important human conditions ."
quantitative measurement of thyroglobulin mrna in peripheral blood of patients after total thyroidectomy .,"previous studies have reported the clinical usefulness of reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) detection of thyroglobulin ( tg ) mrna in the peripheral blood of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma . to evaluate this usefulness , we measured tg mrna in the peripheral blood of patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma after total thyroidectomy by real - time quantitative rt - pcr using glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) mrna as an internal control . surprisingly , we detected tg mrna in all samples obtained after total thyroidectomy , including those from 4 medullary carcinomas . further , there was no statistical difference in expression levels of tg mrna in the patients with or without metastasis , and no significant correlation was found between serum tg concentrations and the expression levels of tg mrna . these results give rise to a question regarding the clinical applications of not only rt - pcr detection but also quantitative measurement of tg mrna in peripheral blood . © 2001 cancer research campaign http://www.bjcancer.com"
functional analysis of the 5 ′ genomic sequence of a bovine norovirus .,"background : jena virus ( jv ) , a bovine norovirus , causes enteric disease in cattle and represents a potential model for the study of enteric norovirus infection and pathogenesis . the positive sense rna genome of jv is organised into orf1 ( non-structural proteins ) , orf2 ( major capsid protein ) and orf3 ( minor capsid protein ) . the lack of a cell culture system for studying jv replication has meant that work to date has relied upon in vitro systems to study non-structural protein synthesis and processing . principal findings : only two of the three major orf1 proteins were identified ( p110 and 2c ) following in vitro translation of jv rna , the n - term protein was not detected . the n - term encoding genomic sequence ( 5 ′ gs ) was tested for ires - like function in a bi-cistronic system and displayed no evidence of ires - like activity . the site of translation initiation in jv was determined to be at the predicted nucleotide 22 . following the insertion of an epitope within the 5 ′ gs the jv n - term protein was identified in vitro and within rna transfected cells . conclusions : the in vitro transcription / translation system is currently the best system for analysing protein synthesis and processing in jv . unlike similarly studied human noroviruses jv initially did not appear to express the n - terminal protein , presenting the possibility that the encoding rna sequence had a regulatory function , most likely involved in translation initiation in an ires - like manner . this was not the case and , following determination of the site of translation initiation the n - term protein was detected using an epitope tag , both in vitro and in vivo . although slightly larger than predicted the n - term protein was detected in a processed form in vivo , thus not only demonstrating initial translation of the orf1 polyprotein but also activity of the viral protease . these findings indicate that the block to noroviral replication in cultured cells lies elsewhere ."
preliminary findings of a randomized trial of non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent influenza transmission in households .,"background : there are sparse data on whether non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce the spread of influenza . we implemented a study of the feasibility and efficacy of face masks and hand hygiene to reduce influenza transmission among hong kong household members . methodology / principal findings : we conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of households ( composed of at least 3 members ) where an index subject presented with influenza - like - illness of < 48 hours duration . after influenza was confirmed in an index case by the quickvue influenza a+b rapid test , the household of the index subject was randomized to 1 ) control or 2 ) surgical face masks or 3 ) hand hygiene . households were visited within 36 hours , and 3 , 6 and 9 days later . nose and throat swabs were collected from index subjects and all household contacts at each home visit and tested by viral culture . the primary outcome measure was laboratory culture confirmed influenza in a household contact ; the secondary outcome was clinically diagnosed influenza ( by self - reported symptoms ) . we randomized 198 households and completed follow up home visits in 128 ; the index cases in 122 of those households had laboratory - confirmed influenza . there were 21 household contacts with laboratory confirmed influenza corresponding to a secondary attack ratio of 6 % . clinical secondary attack ratios varied from 5 % to 18 % depending on case definitions . the laboratory - based or clinical secondary attack ratios did not significantly differ across the intervention arms . adherence to interventions was variable . conclusions / significance : the secondary attack ratios were lower than anticipated , and lower than reported in other countries , perhaps due to differing patterns of susceptibility , lack of significant antigenic drift in circulating influenza virus strains recently , and / or issues related to the symptomatic recruitment design . lessons learnt from this pilot have informed changes for the main study in 2008 . trial registration : clinicaltrials.gov nct00425893 hkclinicaltrials.com hkctr - 365"
real time bayesian estimation of the epidemic potential of emerging infectious diseases .,"background : fast changes in human demographics worldwide , coupled with increased mobility , and modified land uses make the threat of emerging infectious diseases increasingly important . currently there is worldwide alert for h5n1 avian influenza becoming as transmissible in humans as seasonal influenza , and potentially causing a pandemic of unprecedented proportions . here we show how epidemiological surveillance data for emerging infectious diseases can be interpreted in real time to assess changes in transmissibility with quantified uncertainty , and to perform running time predictions of new cases and guide logistics allocations . methodology / principal findings : we develop an extension of standard epidemiological models , appropriate for emerging infectious diseases , that describes the probabilistic progression of case numbers due to the concurrent effects of ( incipient ) human transmission and multiple introductions from a reservoir . the model is cast in terms of surveillance observables and immediately suggests a simple graphical estimation procedure for the effective reproductive number r ( mean number of cases generated by an infectious individual ) of standard epidemics . for emerging infectious diseases , which typically show large relative case number fluctuations over time , we develop a bayesian scheme for real time estimation of the probability distribution of the effective reproduction number and show how to use such inferences to formulate significance tests on future epidemiological observations . conclusions / significance : violations of these significance tests define statistical anomalies that may signal changes in the epidemiology of emerging diseases and should trigger further field investigation . we apply the methodology to case data from world health organization reports to place bounds on the current transmissibility of h5n1 influenza in humans and establish a statistical basis for monitoring its evolution in real time ."

expression of foot - and - mouth disease virus capsid proteins in silkworm - baculovirus expression system and its utilization as a subunit vaccine .,"background : foot - and - mouth disease ( fmd ) is a highly contagious disease of livestock that causes severe economic loss in susceptible cloven - hoofed animals . although the traditional inactivated vaccine has been proved effective , it may lead to a new outbreak of fmd because of either incomplete inactivation of fmdv or the escape of live virus from vaccine production workshop . thus , it is urgent to develop a novel fmdv vaccine that is safer , more effective and more economical than traditional vaccines . methodology and principal findings : a recombinant silkworm baculovirus bm - p12a3c which contained the intact p1 - 2a and 3c protease coding regions of fmdv asia 1 / hnk / cha / 05 was developed . indirect immunofluorescence test and sandwich - elisa were used to verify that bm - p12a3c could express the target cassette . expression products from silkworm were diluted to 30 folds and used as antigen to immunize cattle . specific antibody was induced in all vaccinated animals . after challenge with virulent homologous virus , four of the five animals were completely protected , and clinical symptoms were alleviated and delayed in the remaining one . furthermore , a pd ( 50 ) ( 50 % bovine protective dose ) test was performed to assess the bovine potency of the subunit vaccine . the result showed the subunit vaccine could achieve 6.34 pd ( 50 ) per dose . conclusion : the results suggest that this strategy might be used to develop the new subunit fmdv vaccine ."
the effect of network mixing patterns on epidemic dynamics and the efficacy of disease contact tracing .,"in networks , nodes may preferentially contact other nodes with similar ( assortatively mixed ) or dissimilar ( disassortatively mixed ) numbers of contacts . different patterns of contact support different epidemic dynamics , potentially affecting the efficacy of control measures such as contact tracing , which aims to identify and isolate nodes with infectious contacts . we used stochastic simulations to investigate the effects of mixing patterns on epidemic dynamics and contact - tracing efficacy . for uncontrolled epidemics , outbreaks occur at lower infection rates for more assortatively mixed networks , with faster initial epidemic growth rate and shorter epidemic duration than for disassortatively mixed networks . contact tracing performs better for assortative mixing where epidemic size is large and tracing rate low , but it performs better for disassortative mixing at higher contact rates . for assortatively mixed networks , disease spreads first to highly connected nodes , but this is balanced by contact tracing quickly identifying these same nodes . the converse is true for disassortative mixing , where both disease and tracing are less likely to target highly connected nodes . for small epidemics , contact tracing is more effective on disassortative networks due to the greater resilience of assortative networks to link removal . multi-step contact tracing is more effective than single - step tracing for assortative mixing , but this effect is smaller for disassortatively mixed networks ."
general practice and pandemic influenza : a framework for planning and comparison of plans in five countries .,"background : although primary health care , and in particular , general practice will be at the frontline in the response to pandemic influenza , there are no frameworks to guide systematic planning for this task or to appraise available plans for their relevance to general practice . we aimed to develop a framework that will facilitate planning for general practice , and used it to appraise pandemic plans from australia , england , usa , new zealand and canada . methodology / principal findings : we adapted the haddon matrix to develop the framework , populating its cells through a multi-method study that incorporated the peer - reviewed and grey literature , interviews with general practitioners , practice nurses and senior decision - makers , and desktop simulation exercises . we used the framework to analyse 89 publicly - available jurisdictional plans at similar managerial levels in the five countries . the framework identifies four functional domains : clinical care for influenza and other needs , public health responsibilities , the internal environment and the macro-environment of general practice . no plan addressed all four domains . most plans either ignored or were sketchy about non-influenza clinical needs , and about the contribution of general practice to public health beyond surveillance . collaborations between general practices were addressed in few plans , and inter-relationships with the broader health system , even less frequently . conclusions : this is the first study to provide a framework to guide general practice planning for pandemic influenza . the framework helped identify critical shortcomings in available plans . engaging general practice effectively in planning is challenging , particularly where governance structures for primary health care are weak . we identify implications for practice and for research ."
apoptotic signals induce specific degradation of ribosomal rna in yeast .,"organisms exposed to reactive oxygen species , generated endogenously during respiration or by environmental conditions , undergo oxidative stress . stress response can either repair the damage or activate one of the programmed cell death ( pcd ) mechanisms , for example apoptosis , and finally end in cell death . one striking characteristic , which accompanies apoptosis in both vertebrates and yeast , is a fragmentation of cellular dna and mammalian apoptosis is often associated with degradation of different rnas . we show that in yeast exposed to stimuli known to induce apoptosis , such as hydrogen peroxide , acetic acid , hyperosmotic stress and ageing , two large subunit ribosomal rnas , 25s and 5.8 s , became extensively degraded with accumulation of specific intermediates that differ slightly depending on cell death conditions . this process is most likely endonucleolytic , is correlated with stress response , and depends on the mitochondrial respiratory status : rrna is less susceptible to degradation in respiring cells with functional defence against oxidative stress . in addition , rna fragmentation is independent of two yeast apoptotic factors , metacaspase yca1 and apoptosis - inducing factor aif1 , but it relies on the apoptotic chromatin condensation induced by histone h2b modifications . these data describe a novel phenotype for certain stress - and ageing - related pcd pathways in yeast ."
virus adaptation by manipulation of host 's gene expression .,"viruses adapt to their hosts by evading defense mechanisms and taking over cellular metabolism for their own benefit . alterations in cell metabolism as well as side - effects of antiviral responses contribute to symptoms development and virulence . sometimes , a virus may spill over from its usual host species into a novel one , where usually will fail to successfully infect and further transmit to new host . however , in some cases , the virus transmits and persists after fixing beneficial mutations that allow for a better exploitation of the new host . this situation would represent a case for a new emerging virus . here we report results from an evolution experiment in which a plant virus was allowed to infect and evolve on a naïve host . after 17 serial passages , the viral genome has accumulated only five changes , three of which were non-synonymous . an amino acid substitution in the viral vpg protein was responsible for the appearance of symptoms , whereas one substitution in the viral p3 protein the epistatically contributed to exacerbate severity . dna microarray analyses show that the evolved and ancestral viruses affect the global patterns of host gene expression in radically different ways . a major difference is that genes involved in stress and pathogen response are not activated upon infection with the evolved virus , suggesting that selection has favored viral strategies to escape from host defenses ."
deletion of human metapneumovirus m2 - 2 increases mutation frequency and attenuates growth in hamsters .,"background : human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) infection can cause acute lower respiratory tract illness in infants , the immunocompromised , and the elderly . currently there are no licensed preventative measures for hmpv infections . using a variant of hmpv / nl / 1/00 that does not require trypsin supplementation for growth in tissue culture , we deleted the m2 - 2 gene and evaluated the replication of rhmpv / δm2 - 2 virus in vitro and in vivo . results : in vitro studies showed that the ablation of m2 - 2 increased the propensity for insertion of u nucleotides in poly - u tracts of the genomic rna . in addition , viral transcription was up - regulated although the level of genomic rna remained comparable to rhmpv . thus , deletion of m2 - 2 alters the ratio between hmpv genome copies and transcripts . in vivo , rhmpv / δm2 - 2 was attenuated compared to rhmpv in the lungs and nasal turbinates of hamsters . hamsters immunized with one dose of rhmpv / δm2 - 2 were protected from challenge with 10 ( 6 ) pfu of wild type ( wt ) hmpv / nl / 1/00 . conclusion : our results suggest that hmpv m2 - 2 alters regulation of transcription and influences the fidelity of the polymerase complex during viral genome replication . in the hamster model , rhmpvδm2 - 2 is attenuated and protective suggesting that deletion of m2 - 2 may result in a potential live vaccine candidate . a more thorough knowledge of the hmpv polymerase complex and the role of m2 - 2 during hmpv replication are being studied as we develop a potential live hmpv vaccine candidate that lacks m2 - 2 expression ."
no longer an innocent bystander : epithelial toll - like receptor signaling in the development of mucosal inflammation .,"diseases of mucosal inflammation represent important causes of morbidity and mortality , and have led to intense research efforts to understand the factors that lead to their development . it is well accepted that a breakdown of the normally impermeant epithelial barrier of the intestine , the lung , and the kidney is associated with the development of inflammatory disease in these organs , yet significant controversy exists as to how this breakdown actually occurs , and how such a breakdown may lead to inflammation . in this regard , much work has focused upon the role of the epithelium as an “ innocent bystander , ” a target of a leukocyte - mediated inflammatory cascade that leads to its destruction in the mucosal inflammatory process . however , recent evidence from a variety of laboratories indicates that the epithelium is not merely a passive component in the steps that lead to mucosal inflammation , but is a central participant in the process . in addressing this controversy , we and others have determined that epithelial cells express toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) of the innate immune system , and that activation of tlrs by endogenous and exogenous ligands may play a central role in determining the balance between a state of “ mucosal homeostasis , ” as is required for optimal organ function , and “ mucosal injury , ” leading to mucosal inflammation and barrier breakdown . in particular , activation of tlrs within intestinal epithelial cells leads to the development of cellular injury and impairment in mucosal repair in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation , while activation of tlrs in the lung and kidney may participate in the development of pneumonitis and nephritis respectively . recent work in support of these concepts is extensively reviewed , while essential areas of further study that are required to determine the significance of epithelial tlr signaling during states of health and disease are outlined ."
ubiquitination is required for effective replication of coxsackievirus b3 .,"background : protein ubiquitination and / or degradation by the ubiquitin / proteasome system ( ups ) have been recognized as critical mechanisms in the regulation of numerous essential cellular functions . the importance of the ups in viral pathogenesis has become increasingly apparent . using murine cardiomyocytes , we have previously demonstrated that the ups plays a key role in the replication of coxsackievirus b3 ( cvb3 ) , an important human pathogen associated with various diseases . to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms , we examined the interplay between the ups and cvb3 , focusing on the role of ubiquitination in viral lifecycle . methodology / principal findings : as assessed by in situ hybridization , western blot , and plaque assay , we showed that proteasome inhibition decreased cvb3 rna replication , protein synthesis , and viral titers in hela cells . there were no apparent changes in 20s proteasome activities following cvb3 infection . however , we found viral infection led to an accumulation of protein - ubiquitin conjugates , accompanied by a decreased protein expression of free ubiquitin , implicating an important role of ubiquitination in the ups - mediated viral replication . using small - interfering rna , we demonstrated that gene - silencing of ubiquitin significantly reduced viral titers , possibly through downregulation of protein ubiquitination and subsequent alteration of protein function and / or degradation . inhibition of deubiquitinating enzymes apparently enhances the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors on cvb3 replication . finally , by immunoprecipitation , we showed that coxsackieviral polymerase 3d was post-translationally modified by ubiquitination and such modification might be a prerequisite for its function in transcriptional regulation of viral genome . conclusion : coxsackievirus infection promotes protein ubiquitination , contributing to effective viral replication , probably through ubiquitin modification of viral polymerase ."
professional and home - made face masks reduce exposure to respiratory infections among the general population .,"background : governments are preparing for a potential influenza pandemic . therefore they need data to assess the possible impact of interventions . face - masks worn by the general population could be an accessible and affordable intervention , if effective when worn under routine circumstances . methodology : we assessed transmission reduction potential provided by personal respirators , surgical masks and home - made masks when worn during a variety of activities by healthy volunteers and a simulated patient . principal findings : all types of masks reduced aerosol exposure , relatively stable over time , unaffected by duration of wear or type of activity , but with a high degree of individual variation . personal respirators were more efficient than surgical masks , which were more efficient than home - made masks . regardless of mask type , children were less well protected . outward protection ( mask wearing by a mechanical head ) was less effective than inward protection ( mask wearing by healthy volunteers ) . conclusions / significance : any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level , in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence , personal respirators providing most protection . masks worn by patients may not offer as great a degree of protection against aerosol transmission ."
oct - 4 expression maintained cancer stem - like properties in lung cancer - derived cd133 - positive cells .,"cd133 ( prominin - 1 ) , a 5 - transmembrane glycoprotein , has recently been considered to be an important marker that represents the subset population of cancer stem - like cells . herein we report the isolation of cd133 - positive cells ( lc - cd133 ( + ) ) and cd133 - negative cells ( lc - cd133 ( − ) ) from tissue samples of ten patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( lc ) and five lc cell lines . lc - cd133 ( + ) displayed higher oct - 4 expressions with the ability to self - renew and may represent a reservoir with proliferative potential for generating lung cancer cells . furthermore , lc - cd133 ( + ) , unlike lc - cd133 ( − ) , highly co-expressed the multiple drug - resistant marker abcg2 and showed significant resistance to chemotherapy agents ( i.e. , cisplatin , etoposide , doxorubicin , and paclitaxel ) and radiotherapy . the treatment of oct - 4 sirna with lentiviral vector can specifically block the capability of lc - cd133 ( + ) to form spheres and can further facilitate lc - cd133 ( + ) to differentiate into lc - cd133 ( − ) . in addition , knock - down of oct - 4 expression in lc - cd133 ( + ) can significantly inhibit the abilities of tumor invasion and colony formation , and increase apoptotic activities of caspase 3 and poly ( adp - ribose ) polymerase ( parp ) . finally , in vitro and in vivo studies further confirm that the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy for lc - cd133 ( + ) can be improved by the treatment of oct - 4 sirna . in conclusion , we demonstrated that oct - 4 expression plays a crucial role in maintaining the self - renewing , cancer stem - like , and chemoradioresistant properties of lc - cd133 ( + ) . future research is warranted regarding the up - regulated expression of oct - 4 in lc - cd133 ( + ) and malignant lung cancer ."
early transcriptional response in the jejunum of germ - free piglets after oral infection with virulent rotavirus .,"germ - free piglets were orally infected with virulent rotavirus to collect jejunal mucosal scrapings at 12 and 18 hours post infection ( two piglets per time point ) . ifn - gamma mrna expression was stimulated in the mucosa of all four infected piglets , indicating that they all responded to the rotavirus infection . rna pools prepared from two infected piglets were used to compare whole mucosal gene expression at 12 and 18 hpi to expression in uninfected germ - free piglets ( n = 3 ) using a porcine intestinal cdna microarray . microarray analysis identified 13 down - regulated and 17 up - regulated genes . northern blot analysis of a selected group of genes confirmed the data of the microarray . genes were functionally clustered in interferon - regulated genes , proliferation / differentiation genes , apoptosis genes , cytoskeleton genes , signal transduction genes , and enterocyte digestive , absorptive , and transport genes . down - regulation of the transport gene cluster reflected in part the loss of rotavirus - infected enterocytes from the villous tips . data mining suggested that several genes were regulated in lower - or mid-villus immature enterocytes and goblet cells , probably to support repair of the damaged epithelial cell layer at the villous tips . furthermore , up - regulation was observed for ifn - γ induced guanylate binding protein 2 , a protein that effectively inhibited vsv and emcv replication in vitro ( arch virol 150:1213 – 1220 , 2005 ) . this protein may play a role in the small intestine ’s innate defense against enteric viruses like rotavirus . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10.1007 / s00705 -008-0118-6 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users ."
"gatekeepers of health : a qualitative assessment of child care centre staff 's perspectives , practices and challenges to enteric illness prevention and management in child care centres .","background : enteric outbreaks associated with child care centres ( ccc ) have been well documented internationally and in canada . the current literature focuses on identifying potential risk factors for introduction and transmission of enteric disease , but does not examine why these risk factors happen , how the risk is understood and managed by the staff of cccs , or what challenges they experience responding to enteric illness . the purpose of this study was to explore the understanding , knowledge and actions of ccc staff regarding enteric illness and outbreaks , and to identify challenges that staff encounter while managing them . methods : focus groups were conducted with staff of regulated cccs in southern ontario . five focus groups were held with 40 participants . an open ended style of interviewing was used . data were analyzed using content analysis . results : ccc staff play an important role in preventing and managing enteric illness . staff used in - depth knowledge of the children , the centre and their personal experiences to assist in making decisions related to enteric illness . the decisions and actions may differ from guidance provided by public health officials , particularly when faced with challenges related to time , money , staffing and parents . conclusion : ccc staff relied on experience and judgment in coordination with public health information to assist decision - making in the management of enteric illness and outbreaks . advice and guidance from public health officials to ccc staff needs to be consistent yet flexible so that it may be adapted in a variety of situations and meet regulatory and public health requirements ."
dating the time of viral subtype divergence .,"precise dating of viral subtype divergence enables researchers to correlate divergence with geographic and demographic occurrences . when historical data are absent ( that is , the overwhelming majority ) , viral sequence sampling on a time scale commensurate with the rate of substitution permits the inference of the times of subtype divergence . currently , researchers use two strategies to approach this task , both requiring strong conditions on the molecular clock assumption of substitution rate . as the underlying structure of the substitution rate process at the time of subtype divergence is not understood and likely highly variable , we present a simple method that estimates rates of substitution , and from there , times of divergence , without use of an assumed molecular clock . we accomplish this by blending estimates of the substitution rate for triplets of dated sequences where each sequence draws from a distinct viral subtype , providing a zeroth - order approximation for the rate between subtypes . as an example , we calculate the time of divergence for three genes among influenza subtypes a-h3n2 and b using subtype c as an outgroup . we show a time of divergence approximately 100 years ago , substantially more recent than previous estimates which range from 250 to 3800 years ago ."
discovery and development of toll - like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) antagonists : a new paradigm for treating sepsis and other diseases .,"sepsis remains the most common cause of death in intensive care units in the usa , with a current estimate of at least 750,000 cases per year , and 215,000 deaths annually . despite extensive research still we do not quite understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are involved in triggering and propagation of septic injury . endotoxin ( lipopolysaccharide from gram - negative bacteria , or lps ) has been implicated as a major cause of this syndrome . inflammatory shock as a consequence of lps release remains a serious clinical concern . in humans , inflammatory responses to lps result in the release of cytokines and other cell mediators from monocytes and macrophages , which can cause fever , shock , organ failure and death . a number of different approaches have been investigated to try to treat and / or prevent the septic shock associated with infections caused by gram - negative bacteria , including blockage of one or more of the cytokines induced by lps . recently several novel amphipathic compounds have been developed as direct lps antagonists at the lps receptor , tlr4 . this review article will outline the current knowledge on the tlr4 - lps synthesis and discuss the signaling , in vitro pre-clinical and in vivo clinical evaluation of tlr4 antagonists and their potential use in sepsis and a variety of diseases such as atherosclerosis as well as hepatic and renal malfunction ."
multiplex cytokine profile from dengue patients : mip - 1beta and ifn - gamma as predictive factors for severity .,"background : dengue virus pathogenesis is not yet fully understood and the identification of patients at high risk for developing severe disease forms is still a great challenge in dengue patient care . during the present study , we evaluated prospectively the potential of cytokines present in plasma from patients with dengue in stratifying disease severity . methods : seventeen - cytokine multiplex fluorescent microbead immunoassay was used for the simultaneous detection in 59 dengue patients . glm models using bimodal or gaussian family were determined in order to associate cytokines with clinical manifestations and laboratory diagnosis . results : il - 1β , ifn - γ , il - 4 , il - 6 , il - 13 , il - 7 and gm - csf were significantly increased in patients with severe clinical manifestations ( severe dengue ) when compared to mild disease forms ( mild dengue ) . in contrast , increased mip - 1β levels were observed in patients with mild dengue . mip - 1β was also associated with cd56 + nk cell circulating rates . il - 1β , il - 8 , tnf - α and mcp - 1 were associated with marked thrombocytopenia . increased mcp - 1 and gm - csf levels correlated with hypotension . moreover , mip - 1β and ifn - γ were independently associated with both dengue severity and disease outcome . conclusion : our data demonstrated that the use of a multiple cytokine assay platform was suitable for identifying distinct cytokine profiles associated with the dengue clinical manifestations and severity . mip - β is indicated for the first time as a good prognostic marker in contrast to ifn - γ that was associated with disease severity ."
temporal trends in the discovery of human viruses .,"on average , more than two new species of human virus are reported every year . we constructed the cumulative species discovery curve for human viruses going back to 1901 . we fitted a statistical model to these data ; the shape of the curve strongly suggests that the process of virus discovery is far from complete . we generated a 95 % credible interval for the pool of as yet undiscovered virus species of 38 – 562 . we extrapolated the curve and generated an estimate of 10 – 40 new species to be discovered by 2020 . although we can not predict the level of health threat that these new viruses will present , we conclude that novel virus species must be anticipated in public health planning . more systematic virus discovery programmes , covering both humans and potential animal reservoirs of human viruses , should be considered ."
investigating selection on viruses : a statistical alignment approach .,"background : two problems complicate the study of selection in viral genomes : firstly , the presence of genes in overlapping reading frames implies that selection in one reading frame can bias our estimates of neutral mutation rates in another reading frame . secondly , the high mutation rates we are likely to encounter complicate the inference of a reliable alignment of genomes . to address these issues , we develop a model that explicitly models selection in overlapping reading frames . we then integrate this model into a statistical alignment framework , enabling us to estimate selection while explicitly dealing with the uncertainty of individual alignments . we show that in this way we obtain un-biased selection parameters for different genomic regions of interest , and can improve in accuracy compared to using a fixed alignment . results : we run a series of simulation studies to gauge how well we do in selection estimation , especially in comparison to the use of a fixed alignment . we show that the standard practice of using a clustalw alignment can lead to considerable biases and that estimation accuracy increases substantially when explicitly integrating over the uncertainty in inferred alignments . we even manage to compete favourably for general evolutionary distances with an alignment produced by genal . we subsequently run our method on hiv2 and hepatitis b sequences . conclusion : we propose that marginalizing over all alignments , as opposed to using a fixed one , should be considered in any parametric inference from divergent sequence data for which the alignments are not known with certainty . moreover , we discover in hiv2 that double coding regions appear to be under less stringent selection than single coding ones . additionally , there appears to be evidence for differential selection , where one overlapping reading frame is under positive and the other under negative selection ."
seasonality of influenza a ( h3n2 ) virus : a hong kong perspective ( 1997 – 2006 ),"background : the underlying basis for the seasonality of influenza a viruses is still uncertain . phylogenetic studies investigated this phenomenon but have lacked sequences from more subtropical and tropical regions , particularly from southeast asia . methodology / principal findings : 281 complete hemagglutinin ( ha ) and neuraminidase ( na ) sequences were obtained from influenza a ( h3n2 ) viruses , collected over 10 years ( 1997 – 2006 ) from hong kong . these dated sequences were analyzed with influenza a ( h3n2 ) vaccine strain sequences ( syd / 5/97 , mos / 10/99 , fuj / 411/02 , cal / 7/04 ) and 315 other publicly available dated sequences from elsewhere , worldwide . in addition , the na sequence alignment was inspected for the presence of any naturally occurring , known , neuraminidase inhibitor ( nai ) resistance - associated amino acid mutations ( r292k and e119v ) . before 2001 , the hong kong ha and na sequences clustered more closely with the older vaccine sequences ( syd / 5/97 , mos / 10/99 ) than did sequences from elsewhere . after 2001 , this trend reversed with significant clusters containing ha and na sequences from different locations , isolated at different times , suggesting that viral migration may account for much of the influenza a ( h3n2 ) seasonality during this 10 - year period . however , at least one example from hong kong was found suggesting that in some years , influenza a ( h3n2 ) viruses may persist in the same location , perhaps continuing to circulate , sub-clinically , at low levels between seasons , to re-emerge in the influenza season the following year , relatively unchanged . none of these hong kong influenza a ( h3n2 ) na sequences contained any of the known nai - resistance associated mutations . conclusions / significance : the seasonality of influenza a ( h3n2 ) may be largely due to global migration , with similar viruses appearing in different countries at different times . however , occasionally , some viruses may remain within a single location and continue to circulate within that population , to re-emerge during the next influenza season , with relatively little genetic change . naturally occurring nai resistance mutations were absent or , at least , very rare in this population ."
h5n1 and 1918 pandemic influenza virus infection results in early and excessive infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs of mice .,"fatal human respiratory disease associated with the 1918 pandemic influenza virus and potentially pandemic h5n1 viruses is characterized by severe lung pathology , including pulmonary edema and extensive inflammatory infiltrate . here , we quantified the cellular immune response to infection in the mouse lung by flow cytometry and demonstrate that mice infected with highly pathogenic ( hp ) h1n1 and h5n1 influenza viruses exhibit significantly high numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs compared to mice infected with low pathogenic ( lp ) viruses . mice infected with the 1918 pandemic virus and a recent h5n1 human isolate show considerable similarities in overall lung cellularity , lung immune cell sub-population composition and cellular immune temporal dynamics . interestingly , while these similarities were observed , the hp h5n1 virus consistently elicited significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in whole lungs and primary human macrophages , revealing a potentially critical difference in the pathogenesis of h5n1 infections . these results together show that infection with hp influenza viruses such as h5n1 and the 1918 pandemic virus leads to a rapid cell recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils into the lungs , suggesting that these cells play a role in acute lung inflammation associated with hp influenza virus infection . in addition , primary macrophages and dendritic cells were also susceptible to 1918 and h5n1 influenza virus infection in vitro and in infected mouse lung tissue ."
patterns of positive selection in six mammalian genomes .,"genome - wide scans for positively selected genes ( psgs ) in mammals have provided insight into the dynamics of genome evolution , the genetic basis of differences between species , and the functions of individual genes . however , previous scans have been limited in power and accuracy owing to small numbers of available genomes . here we present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian psgs to date , using the six high - coverage genome assemblies now available for eutherian mammals . the increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in substantially improved statistical power , and permits several new lineage - and clade - specific tests to be applied . of ∼ 16,500 human genes with high - confidence orthologs in at least two other species , 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection ( fdr < 0.05 ) , according to a standard likelihood ratio test . an additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades . as in previous studies , the identified psgs were enriched for roles in defense / immunity , chemosensory perception , and reproduction , but enrichments were also evident for more specific functions , such as complement - mediated immunity and taste perception . several pathways were strongly enriched for psgs , suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes . a novel bayesian analysis of the possible “ selection histories ” of each gene indicated that most psgs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection , suggesting that positive selection is often episodic . a detailed analysis of affymetrix exon array data indicated that psgs are expressed at significantly lower levels , and in a more tissue - specific manner , than non-psgs . genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen , testes , liver , and breast are significantly enriched for psgs , but no evidence was found for an enrichment for psgs among brain - specific genes . this study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome - wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection ."

the geosimulation of west nile virus propagation : a multi-agent and climate sensitive tool for risk management in public health .,"background : since 1999 , the expansion of the west nile virus ( wnv ) epizooty has led public health authorities to build and operate surveillance systems in north america . these systems are very useful to collect data , but can not be used to forecast the probable spread of the virus in coming years . such forecasts , if proven reliable , would permit preventive measures to be put into place at the appropriate level of expected risk and at the appropriate time . it is within this context that the multi-agent geosimulation approach has been selected to develop a system that simulates the interactions of populations of mosquitoes and birds over space and time in relation to the spread and transmission of wnv . this simulation takes place in a virtual mapping environment representing a large administrative territory ( e.g. province , state ) and carried out under various climate scenarios in order to simulate the effects of vector control measures such as larviciding at scales of 1/20 000 or smaller . results : after setting some hypotheses , a conceptual model and system architecture were developed to describe the population dynamics and interactions of mosquitoes ( genus culex ) and american crows , which were chosen as the main actors in the simulation . based on a mathematical compartment model used to simulate the population dynamics , an operational prototype was developed for the southern part of quebec ( canada ) . the system allows users to modify the parameters of the model , to select various climate and larviciding scenarios , to visualize on a digital map the progression ( on a weekly or daily basis ) of the infection in and around the crows ' roosts and to generate graphs showing the evolution of the populations . the basic units for visualisation are municipalities . conclusion : in all likelihood this system might be used to support short term decision - making related to wnv vector control measures , including the use of larvicides , according to climatic scenarios . once fully calibrated in several real - life contexts , this promising approach opens the door to the study and management of other zoonotic diseases such as lyme disease ."
alternative medicines for aids in resource - poor settings : insights from exploratory anthropological studies in asia and africa .,"the emergence of alternative medicines for aids in asia and africa was discussed at a satellite symposium and the parallel session on alternative and traditional treatments of the aidsimpact meeting , held in marseille , in july 2007 . these medicines are heterogeneous , both in their presentation and in their geographic and cultural origin . the sessions focused on the role of these medications in selected resource poor settings in africa and asia now that access to anti-retroviral therapy is increasing . the aims of the sessions were to ( 1 ) identify the actors involved in the diffusion of these alternative medicines for hiv / aids , ( 2 ) explore uses and forms , and the way these medicines are given legitimacy , ( 3 ) reflect on underlying processes of globalisation and cultural differentiation , and ( 4 ) define priority questions for future research in this area . this article presents the insights generated at the meeting , illustrated with some findings from the case studies ( uganda , senegal , benin , burkina faso , china and indonesia ) that were presented . these case studies reveal the wide range of actors who are involved in the marketing and supply of alternative medicines . regulatory mechanisms are weak . the efficacy claims of alternative medicines often reinforce a biomedical paradigm for hiv / aids , and fit with a healthy living ideology promoted by aids care programs and support groups . the aidsimpact session concluded that more interdisciplinary research is needed on the experience of people living with hiv / aids with these alternative medicines , and on the ways in which these products interact ( or not ) with anti-retroviral therapy at pharmacological as well as psychosocial levels ."
evolutionary and transmission dynamics of reassortant h5n1 influenza virus in indonesia .,"h5n1 highly pathogenic avian influenza ( hpai ) viruses have seriously affected the asian poultry industry since their recurrence in 2003 . the viruses pose a threat of emergence of a global pandemic influenza through point mutation or reassortment leading to a strain that can effectively transmit among humans . in this study , we present phylogenetic evidences for the interlineage reassortment among h5n1 hpai viruses isolated from humans , cats , and birds in indonesia , and identify the potential genetic parents of the reassorted genome segments . parsimony analyses of viral phylogeography suggest that the reassortant viruses may have originated from greater jakarta and surroundings , and subsequently spread to other regions in the west java province . in addition , bayesian methods were used to elucidate the genetic diversity dynamics of the reassortant strain and one of its genetic parents , which revealed a more rapid initial growth of genetic diversity in the reassortant viruses relative to their genetic parent . these results demonstrate that interlineage exchange of genetic information may play a pivotal role in determining viral genetic diversity in a focal population . moreover , our study also revealed significantly stronger diversifying selection on the m1 and pb2 genes in the lineages preceding and subsequent to the emergence of the reassortant viruses , respectively . we discuss how the corresponding mutations might drive the adaptation and onward transmission of the newly formed reassortant viruses ."
endothelial cells support persistent gammaherpesvirus 68 infection .,"a variety of human diseases are associated with gammaherpesviruses , including neoplasms of lymphocytes ( e.g. burkitt 's lymphoma ) and endothelial cells ( e.g. kaposi 's sarcoma ) . gammaherpesvirus infections usually result in either a productive lytic infection , characterized by expression of all viral genes and rapid cell lysis , or latent infection , characterized by limited viral gene expression and no cell lysis . here , we report characterization of endothelial cell infection with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 ( γhv68 ) , a virus phylogenetically related and biologically similar to the human gammaherpesviruses . endothelial cells supported γhv68 replication in vitro , but were unique in that a significant proportion of the cells escaped lysis , proliferated , and remained viable in culture for an extended time . upon infection , endothelial cells became non-adherent and altered in size , complexity , and cell - surface protein expression . these cells were uniformly infected and expressed the lytic transcription program based on detection of abundant viral gene transcripts , gfp fluorescence from the viral genome , and viral surface protein expression . additionally , endothelial cells continued to produce new infectious virions as late as 30 days post-infection . the outcome of this long - term infection was promoted by the γhv68 v - cyclin , because in the absence of the v - cyclin , viability was significantly reduced following infection . importantly , infected primary endothelial cells also demonstrated increased viability relative to infected primary fibroblasts , and this increased viability was dependent on the v - cyclin . finally , we provide evidence for infection of endothelial cells in vivo in immune - deficient mice . the extended viability and virus production of infected endothelial cells indicated that endothelial cells provided a source of prolonged virus production and identify a cell - type specific adaptation of gammaherpesvirus replication . while infected endothelial cells would likely be cleared in a healthy individual , persistently infected endothelial cells could provide a source of continued virus replication in immune - compromised individuals , a context in which gammaherpesvirus - associated pathology frequently occurs ."
analysis of synonymous codon usage and evolution of begomoviruses .,"begomoviruses are single - stranded dna viruses and cause severe diseases in major crop plants worldwide . based on current genome sequence analyses , we found that synonymous codon usage variations in the protein - coding genes of begomoviruses are mainly influenced by mutation bias . base composition analysis suggested that the codon usage bias of av1 and bv1 genes is significant and their expressions are high . fourteen codons were determined as translational optimal ones according to the comparison of codon usage patterns between highly and lowly expressed genes . interestingly the codon usages between begomoviruses from the old and the new worlds are apparently different , which supports the idea that the bipartite begomoviruses of the new world might originate from bipartite ones of the old world , whereas the latter evolve from the old world monopartite begomoviruses ."
animal models of acute lung injury .,"acute lung injury in humans is characterized histopathologically by neutrophilic alveolitis , injury of the alveolar epithelium and endothelium , hyaline membrane formation , and microvascular thrombi . different animal models of experimental lung injury have been used to investigate mechanisms of lung injury . most are based on reproducing in animals known risk factors for ards , such as sepsis , lipid embolism secondary to bone fracture , acid aspiration , ischemia - reperfusion of pulmonary or distal vascular beds , and other clinical risks . however , none of these models fully reproduces the features of human lung injury . the goal of this review is to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of existing models of lung injury . we review the specific features of human ards that should be modeled in experimental lung injury and then discuss specific characteristics of animal species that may affect the pulmonary host response to noxious stimuli . we emphasize those models of lung injury that are based on reproducing risk factors for human ards in animals and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each model and the extent to which each model reproduces human ards . the present review will help guide investigators in the design and interpretation of animal studies of acute lung injury ."
intrapulmonary administration of recombinant activated factor vii in diffuse alveolar haemorrhage : a report of two case stories .,"background : diffuse alveolar haemorrhage ( dah ) is a serious pulmonary complication characterised by a high mortality rate and the absence of specific treatment . the intrapulmonary administration of activated recombinant factor vii ( rfviia ) in dah was recently published in six patients by heslet et al with an efficient hemostatic effect . we describe two cases of dah treated with intrapulmonary rfviia . methods : two cases of dah were admitted to the icu after presenting abrupt desaturation , tachypnea , cough and haemoptysis , requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation . the diagnosis was achieved by the bloody return during the bronchoalveolar lavage , during the procedure rfviia ( 50 μg / kg in 50 ml of isotonic saline ) was administered via the bronchoscope . results : immediate cessation of bleeding was observed . prior to intrapulmonary administration of rfviia , the fio ( 2 ) was 1 , which was reduced to 0.4 24 hours later . following the procedure , the haemostatic effect made blood transfusion superfluous . no thrombotic complications associated with administration of the drug were observed . after the intervention both cases progressed fast and was discharged from the icu with no further episodes of bleeding . conclusion : 1 . local intrabronchial deposition of dah with rfviia has been shown to be effective in controlling life - threatening dah . 2 . in the case described above , no thrombotic complications were observed following the intrapulmonary administration of rfviia ."
activation of the unfolded protein response is required for defenses against bacterial pore - forming toxin in vivo .,"pore - forming toxins ( pfts ) constitute the single largest class of proteinaceous bacterial virulence factors and are made by many of the most important bacterial pathogens . host responses to these toxins are complex and poorly understood . we find that the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response ( upr ) is activated upon exposure to pfts both in caenorhabditis elegans and in mammalian cells . activation of the upr is protective in vivo against pfts since animals that lack either the ire -1-xbp-1 or the atf - 6 arms of the upr are more sensitive to pft than wild - type animals . the upr acts directly in the cells targeted by the pft . loss of the upr leads to a normal response against unrelated toxins or a pathogenic bacterium , indicating its pft - protective role is specific . the p38 mitogen - activated protein ( mapk ) kinase pathway has been previously shown to be important for cellular defenses against pfts . we find here that the upr is one of the key downstream targets of the p38 mapk pathway in response to pft since loss of a functional p38 mapk pathway leads to a failure of pft to properly activate the ire -1-xbp-1 arm of the upr . the upr - mediated activation and response to pfts is distinct from the canonical upr - mediated response to unfolded proteins both in terms of its activation and functional sensitivities . these data demonstrate that the upr , a fundamental intracellular pathway , can operate in intrinsic cellular defenses against bacterial attack ."
composition and function of haemolymphatic tissues in the european common shrew .,"background : studies of wild animals responding to their native parasites are essential if we are to understand how the immune system functions in the natural environment . while immune defence may bring increased survival , this may come at a resource cost to other physiological traits , including reproduction . here , we tested the hypothesis that wild common shrews ( sorex araneus ) , which produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span , forgo investment in immunity and immune system maintenance , as increased longevity is unlikely to bring further opportunities for mating . in particular , we predicted that adult shrews , with shorter expected lifespans , would not respond as effectively as young animals to infection . methodology / principal findings : we examined haemolymphatic tissues from wild - caught common shrews using light and transmission electron microscopy , applied in conjunction with immunohistology . we compared composition and function of these tissues in shrews of different ages , and the extent and type of inflammatory reactions observed in response to natural parasitic infections . all ages seemed able to mount systemic , specific immune responses , but adult shrews showed some signs of lymphatic tissue exhaustion : lymphatic follicles in adults ( n = 21 ) were both smaller than those in sub-adults ( n = 18 ; wald = 11.1 , p < 0.05 ) and exhibited greater levels of depletion ( wald = 13.3 , p < 0.05 ) . conclusions / significance : contrary to our expectations , shrews respond effectively to their natural parasites , and show little indication of immunosenescence as adults . the pancreas of aselli , a unique lymphoid organ , may aid in providing efficient immune responses through the storage of large numbers of plasma cells . this may allow older animals to react effectively to previously encountered parasites , but infection by novel agents , and eventual depletion of plasma cell reserves , could both still be factors in the near - synchronous mortality of adult shrews observed shortly after breeding ."
prevention of cytotoxic t cell escape using a heteroclitic subdominant viral t cell determinant .,"high affinity antigen - specific t cells play a critical role during protective immune responses . epitope enhancement can elicit more potent t cell responses and can subsequently lead to a stronger memory pool ; however , the molecular basis of such enhancement is unclear . we used the consensus peptide - binding motif for the major histocompatibility complex molecule h - 2k ( b ) to design a heteroclitic version of the mouse hepatitis virus - specific subdominant s598 determinant . we demonstrate that a single amino acid substitution at a secondary anchor residue ( q to y at position 3 ) increased the stability of the engineered determinant in complex with h - 2k ( b ) . the structural basis for this enhanced stability was associated with local alterations in the pmhc conformation as a result of the q to y substitution . recombinant viruses encoding this engineered determinant primed ctl responses that also reacted to the wildtype epitope with significantly higher functional avidity , and protected against selection of virus mutated at a second ctl determinant and consequent disease progression in persistently infected mice . collectively , our findings provide a basis for the enhanced immunogenicity of an engineered determinant that will serve as a template for guiding the development of heteroclitic t cell determinants with applications in prevention of ctl escape in chronic viral infections as well as in tumor immunity ."
hiv - specific t - cells accumulate in the liver in hcv / hiv co-infection .,"background and aims : hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) - related liver disease progresses more rapidly in individuals co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus - 1 ( hiv ) , although the underlying immunologic mechanisms are unknown . we examined whether hiv - specific t - cells are identified in the liver of hcv / hiv co-infected individuals and promote liver inflammation through bystander immune responses . methods : ex-vivo intra-hepatic lymphocytes from hcv mono - infected and hcv / hiv co-infected individuals were assessed for immune responses to hiv and hcv antigens by polychromatic flow cytometry . results : hcv / hiv liver biopsies had similar frequencies of lymphocytes but lower percentages of cd4 ( + ) t - cells compared to hcv biopsies . in co-infection , intra-hepatic hiv - specific cd8 ( + ) and cd4 ( + ) t - cells producing ifn - γ and tnf - α were detected and were comparable in frequency to those that were hcv - specific . in co-infected individuals , viral - specific cd8 ( + ) t - cells produced more of the fibrogenic cytokine , tnf - α . in both mono - and co-infected individuals , intra-hepatic hcv - specific t - cells were poorly functional compared to hiv - specific t - cells . in co-infection , haart was not associated with a reconstitution of intra-hepatic cd4 ( + ) t - cells and was associated with reduction in both hiv and hcv - specific intra-hepatic cytokine responses . conclusion : the accumulation of functional hiv - specific t - cells in the liver during hcv / hiv co-infection may represent a bystander role for hiv in inducing faster progression of liver disease ."
multiorgan failure due to hemophagocytic syndrome : a case report .,"introduction : hemophagocytic syndrome ( hfs ) is a potentially lethal disorder due to an uncontrolled immune response to a triggering agent . our objective is to raise the importance of hfs early diagnosis by presenting a representative case . case presentation : a sixteen - year - old girl with still disease diagnosis developed a progressive multiorgan failure including acute respiratory distress ( ards ) , anemia and thrombopenia , elevated liver enzymes , renal failure , coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia , and acute phase reactants elevation despite broad - spectrum antibiotics . a bone marrow puncture - biopsy was performed , and hemophagocytosis was found . prolonged fever , splenomegaly , bicytopenia , hypofibrinogenemia , hyperferritinemia and hypertriglyceridemia confirmed hfs diagnosis . she received intensive care support therapy including mechanical ventilation and specific therapy according to hlh 2004 protocol , with a very good response . conclusion : our case shows complexity of hfs diagnosis , due to septic shock - like manifestations . early diagnosis is essential to start appropriate treatment achieving a better outcome ."
studying copy number variations using a nanofluidic platform .,"copy number variations ( cnvs ) in the human genome are conventionally detected using high - throughput scanning technologies , such as comparative genomic hybridization and high - density single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) microarrays , or relatively low - throughput techniques , such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) . all these approaches are limited in resolution and can at best distinguish a twofold ( or 50 % ) difference in copy number . we have developed a new technology to study copy numbers using a platform known as the digital array , a nanofluidic biochip capable of accurately quantitating genes of interest in dna samples . we have evaluated the digital array 's performance using a model system , to show that this technology is exquisitely sensitive , capable of differentiating as little as a 15 % difference in gene copy number ( or between 6 and 7 copies of a target gene ) . we have also analyzed commercial dna samples for their cyp2d6 copy numbers and confirmed that our results were consistent with those obtained independently using conventional techniques . in a screening experiment with breast cancer and normal dna samples , the erbb2 gene was found to be amplified in about 35 % of breast cancer samples . the use of the digital array enables accurate measurement of gene copy numbers and is of significant value in cnv studies ."
"an analysis of hospital preparedness capacity for public health emergency in four regions of china : beijing , shandong , guangxi , and hainan .","background : hospital preparedness is critical for the early detection and management of public health emergency ( phe ) . understanding the current status of phe preparedness is the first step in planning to enhance hospitals ' capacities for emergency response . the objective of this study is to understand the current status of hospital phe preparedness in china . methods : four hundred hospitals in four city and provinces of china were surveyed using a standardized questionnaire . data related to hospital demographic data ; phe preparation ; response to phe in community ; stockpiles of drugs and materials ; detection and identification of phe ; procedures for medical treatment ; laboratory diagnosis and management ; staff training ; and risk communication were collected and analyzed . results : valid responses were received from 318 ( 79.5 % ) of the 400 hospitals surveyed . of the valid responses , 264 ( 85.2 % ) hospitals had emergency plans ; 93.3 % had command centres and personnel for phe ; 22.9 % included community organisations during the training for phe ; 97.4 % could transport needed medical staff to a phe ; 53.1 % had evaluated stockpiles of drugs ; 61.5 % had evaluated their supply systems ; 55.5 % had developed surveillance systems ; and 74.6 % could monitor the abnormity ( see in appendix ) . physicians in 80.2 % of the analyzed hospitals reported up - to - date knowledge of their institution 's phe protocol . of the 318 respondents , 97.4 % followed strict laboratory regulations , however , only about 33.5 % had protocols for suspected samples . furthermore , only 59.0 % could isolate and identify salmonella and staphylococcus and less than 5 % could isolate and identify human h5n1 avian flu and sars . staff training or drill programs were reported in 94.5 % of the institutions ; 50.3 % periodically assessed the efficacy of staff training ; 45 % had experts to provide psychological counselling ; 12.1 % had provided training for their medical staff to assess phe - related stress . all of the above capacities related to the demographic characteristics of hospitals and will be discussed in - depth in this paper . conclusion : our survey suggested that , at the time of the survey , hospital preparedness for phe in china was at an early stage of development . comprehensive measures should be taken to enhance hospital capacity in the prevention and management of phe ."
molecular evidence for the evolution of ichnoviruses from ascoviruses by symbiogenesis .,"background : female endoparasitic ichneumonid wasps inject virus - like particles into their caterpillar hosts to suppress immunity . these particles are classified as ichnovirus virions and resemble ascovirus virions , which are also transmitted by parasitic wasps and attack caterpillars . ascoviruses replicate dna and produce virions . polydnavirus dna consists of wasp dna replicated by the wasp from its genome , which also directs particle synthesis . structural similarities between ascovirus and ichnovirus particles and the biology of their transmission suggest that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses , although molecular evidence for this hypothesis is lacking . results : here we show that a family of unique pox - d5 ntpase proteins in the glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus are related to three diadromus pulchellus ascovirus proteins encoded by orfs 90 , 91 and 93 . a new alignment technique also shows that two proteins from a related ichnovirus are orthologs of other ascovirus virion proteins . conclusion : our results provide molecular evidence supporting the origin of ichnoviruses from ascoviruses by lateral transfer of ascoviral genes into ichneumonid wasp genomes , perhaps the first example of symbiogenesis between large dna viruses and eukaryotic organisms . we also discuss the limits of this evidence through complementary studies , which revealed that passive lateral transfer of viral genes among polydnaviral , bacterial , and wasp genomes may have occurred repeatedly through an intimate coupling of both recombination and replication of viral genomes during evolution . the impact of passive lateral transfers on evolutionary relationships between polydnaviruses and viruses with large double - stranded genomes is considered in the context of the theory of symbiogenesis ."
nasal delivery of an adenovirus - based vaccine bypasses pre-existing immunity to the vaccine carrier and improves the immune response in mice .,"pre-existing immunity to human adenovirus serotype 5 ( ad5 ) is common in the general population . bypassing pre-existing immunity could maximize ad5 vaccine efficacy . vaccination by the intramuscular ( i.m. ) , nasal ( i.n. ) or oral ( p.o. ) route with ad5 expressing ebola zaire glycoprotein ( ad5 - zgp ) fully protected naïve mice against lethal challenge with ebola . in the presence of pre-existing immunity , only mice vaccinated i.n. survived . the frequency of ifn - γ + cd8 + t cells was reduced by 80 % and by 15 % in animals vaccinated by the i.m. and p.o. routes respectively . neutralizing antibodies could not be detected in serum from either treatment group . pre-existing immunity did not compromise the frequency of ifn - γ + cd8 + t cells ( 3.9 ± 1 % naïve vs. 3.6 ± 1 % pre-existing immunity , pei ) nor anti-ebola neutralizing antibody ( nab , 40 ± 10 reciprocal dilution , both groups ) . the number of inf - γ + cd8 + cells detected in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid ( bal ) after i.n. immunization was not compromised by pre-existing immunity to ad5 ( 146 ± 14 , naïve vs. 120 ± 16 sfc / million mncs , pei ) . however , pre-existing immunity reduced nab levels in bal by ∼ 25 % in this group . to improve the immune response after oral vaccination , the ad5 - based vaccine was pegylated . mice given the modified vaccine did not survive challenge and had reduced levels of ifn - γ + cd8 + t cells 10 days after administration ( 0.3 ± 0.3 % peg vs. 1.7 ± 0.5 % unmodified ) . pegylation did increase nab levels 2-fold . these results provide some insight about the degree of t and b cell mediated immunity necessary for protection against ebola virus and suggest that modification of the virus capsid can influence the type of immune response elicited by an ad5 - based vaccine ."

factors influencing psychological distress during a disease epidemic : data from australia 's first outbreak of equine influenza .,"background : in 2007 australia experienced its first outbreak of highly infectious equine influenza . government disease control measures were put in place to control , contain , and eradicate the disease ; these measures included movement restrictions and quarantining of properties . this study was conducted to assess the psycho - social impacts of this disease , and this paper reports the prevalence of , and factors influencing , psychological distress during this outbreak . methods : data were collected using an online survey , with a link directed to the affected population via a number of industry groups . psychological distress , as determined by the kessler 10 psychological distress scale , was the main outcome measure . results : in total , 2760 people participated in this study . extremely high levels of non-specific psychological distress were reported by respondents in this study , with 34 % reporting high psychological distress ( k10 > 22 ) , compared to levels of around 12 % in the australian general population . analysis , using backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis , revealed that those living in high risk infection ( red ) zones ( or = 2.00 ; 95 % ci : 1.57 – 2.55 ; p < 0.001 ) and disease buffer ( amber ) zones ( or = 1.83 ; 95 % ci : 1.36 – 2.46 ; p < 0.001 ) were at much greater risk of high psychological distress than those living in uninfected ( white zones ) . although prevalence of high psychological distress was greater in infected ei zones and states , elevated levels of psychological distress were experienced in horse - owners nationally . statistical analysis indicated that certain groups were more vulnerable to high psychological distress ; specifically younger people , and those with lower levels of formal educational qualifications . respondents whose principal source of income was from horse - related industry were more than twice as likely to have high psychological distress than those whose primary source of income was not linked to horse - related industry ( or = 2.23 ; 95 % ci : 1.82 – 2.73 ; p < 0.001 ) . conclusion : although , methodologically , this study had good internal validity , it has limited generalisability because it was not possible to identify , bound , or sample the target population accurately . however , this study is the first to collect psychological distress data from an affected population during such a disease outbreak and has potential to inform those involved in assessing the potential psychological impacts of human infectious diseases , such as pandemic influenza ."
influenza a virus inhibits type i ifn signaling via nf - κb - dependent induction of socs - 3 expression .,"the type i interferon ( ifn ) system is a first line of defense against viral infections . viruses have developed various mechanisms to counteract this response . so far , the interferon antagonistic activity of influenza a viruses was mainly observed on the level of ifnβ gene induction via action of the viral non-structural protein 1 ( ns1 ) . here we present data indicating that influenza a viruses not only suppress ifnβ gene induction but also inhibit type i ifn signaling through a mechanism involving induction of the suppressor of cytokine signaling - 3 ( socs - 3 ) protein . our study was based on the observation that in cells that were infected with influenza a virus and subsequently stimulated with ifnα / β , phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1 ( stat1 ) was strongly reduced . this impaired stat1 activation was not due to the action of viral proteins but rather appeared to be induced by accumulation of viral 5 ′ triphosphate rna in the cell . socs proteins are potent endogenous inhibitors of janus kinase ( jak ) / stat signaling . closer examination revealed that socs - 3 but not socs - 1 mrna levels increase in an rna - and nuclear factor kappa b ( nf - κb ) - dependent but type i ifn - independent manner early in the viral replication cycle . this direct viral induction of socs - 3 mrna and protein expression appears to be relevant for suppression of the antiviral response since in socs - 3 deficient cells a sustained phosphorylation of stat1 correlated with elevated expression of type i ifn - dependent genes . as a consequence , progeny virus titers were reduced in socs - 3 deficient cells or in cells were socs - 3 expression was knocked - down by sirna . these data provide the first evidence that influenza a viruses suppress type i ifn signaling on the level of jak / stat activation . the inhibitory effect is at least in part due to the induction of socs - 3 gene expression , which results in an impaired antiviral response ."

key role of splenic myeloid dcs in the ifn - αβ response to adenoviruses in vivo .,"the early systemic production of interferon ( ifn ) - αβ is an essential component of the antiviral host defense mechanisms , but is also thought to contribute to the toxic side effects accompanying gene therapy with adenoviral vectors . here we investigated the ifn - αβ response to human adenoviruses ( ads ) in mice . by comparing the responses of normal , myeloid ( m ) dc - and plasmacytoid ( p ) dc - depleted mice and by measuring ifn - αβ mrna expression in different organs and cells types , we show that in vivo , ads elicit strong and rapid ifn - αβ production , almost exclusively in splenic mdcs . using knockout mice , various strains of ads ( wild type , mutant and uv - inactivated ) and map kinase inhibitors , we demonstrate that the ad - induced ifn - αβ response does not require toll - like receptors ( tlr ) , known cytosolic sensors of rna ( rig - i / mda - 5 ) and dna ( dai ) recognition and interferon regulatory factor ( irf ) - 3 , but is dependent on viral endosomal escape , signaling via the map kinase sapk / jnk and irf - 7 . furthermore , we show that ads induce ifn - αβ and il - 6 in vivo by distinct pathways and confirm that ifn - αβ positively regulates the il - 6 response . finally , by measuring tnf - α responses to lps in ad - infected wild type and ifn - αβr ( − / − ) mice , we show that ifn - αβ is the key mediator of ad - induced hypersensitivity to lps . these findings indicate that , like endosomal tlr signaling in pdcs , tlr - independent virus recognition in splenic mdcs can also produce a robust early ifn - αβ response , which is responsible for the bulk of ifn - αβ production induced by adenovirus in vivo . the signaling requirements are different from known tlr - dependent or cytosolic ifn - αβ induction mechanisms and suggest a novel cytosolic viral induction pathway . the hypersensitivity to components of the microbial flora and invading pathogens may in part explain the toxic side effects of adenoviral gene therapy and contribute to the pathogenesis of adenoviral disease ."
hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome – the markers for an early hses diagnosis .,"background : the hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome ( hses ) is a devastating disease that affects young children . the outcomes of hses patients are often fatal or manifesting severe neurological sequelae . we reviewed the markers for an early diagnosis of hses . methods : we examined the clinical , biological and radiological findings of 8 patients ( 4 months to 9 years old ) who met the hses criteria . results : although cerebral edema , disseminated intravascular coagulopathy ( dic ) , and multiple organ failure were seen in all 8 cases during their clinical courses , brain computed tomography ( ct ) scans showed normal or only slight edema in 5 patients upon admission . all 8 patients had normal platelet counts , and none were in shock . however , they all had severe metabolic acidosis , which persisted even after 3 hours ( median base excess ( be ) , -7.6 mmol / l ) . and at 6 hours after admission ( be , -5.7 mmol / l ) they required mechanical ventilation . within 12 hours after admission , fluid resuscitation and vasopressor infusion for hypotension was required . seven of the patients had elevated liver enzymes and creatine kinase ( ck ) upon admission . twenty - four hours after admission , all 8 patients needed vasopressor infusion to maintain blood pressure . conclusion : ct scan , platelet count , hemoglobin level and renal function upon admission are not useful for an early diagnosis of hses . however , the elevated liver enzymes and ck upon admission , hypotension in the early stage after admission with refractory acid - base disturbance to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor infusion are useful markers for an early hses diagnosis and helpful to indicate starting intensive neurological treatment ."
unifying evolutionary and thermodynamic information for rna folding of multiple alignments .,"computational methods for determining the secondary structure of rna sequences from given alignments are currently either based on thermodynamic folding , compensatory base pair substitutions or both . however , there is currently no approach that combines both sources of information in a single optimization problem . here , we present a model that formally integrates both the energy - based and evolution - based approaches to predict the folding of multiple aligned rna sequences . we have implemented an extended version of pfold that identifies base pairs that have high probabilities of being conserved and of being energetically favorable . the consensus structure is predicted using a maximum expected accuracy scoring scheme to smoothen the effect of incorrectly predicted base pairs . parameter tuning revealed that the probability of base pairing has a higher impact on the rna structure prediction than the corresponding probability of being single stranded . furthermore , we found that structurally conserved rna motifs are mostly supported by folding energies . other problems ( e.g. rna - folding kinetics ) may also benefit from employing the principles of the model we introduce . our implementation , petfold , was tested on a set of 46 well - curated rfam families and its performance compared favorably to that of pfold and rnaalifold ."
a sensitive array - based assay for identifying multiple tmprss2 : erg fusion gene variants .,"studies of gene fusions in solid tumors are not as extensive as in hematological malignancies due to several technical and analytical problems associated with tumor heterogeneity . nevertheless , there is a growing interest in the role of fusion genes in common epithelial tumors after the discovery of recurrent tmprss2 : ets fusions in prostate cancer . among all of the reported fusion partners in the ets gene family , tmprss2 : erg is the most prevalent one . here , we present a simple and sensitive microarray - based assay that is able to simultaneously determine multiple fusion variants with a single rt – pcr in impure rna specimens . the assay detected tmprss2 : erg fusion transcripts with a detection sensitivity of < 10 cells in the presence of more than 3000 times excess normal rna , and in primary prostate tumors having no > 1 % of cancer cells . the ability to detect multiple transcript variants in a single assay is critically dependent on both the primer and probe designs . the assay should facilitate clinical and basic studies for fusion gene screening in clinical specimens , as it can be readily adapted to include multiple gene loci ."
delivery of steric block morpholino oligomers by ( r - x-r ) ( 4 ) peptides : structure – activity studies .,"redirecting the splicing machinery through the hybridization of high affinity , rnase h - incompetent oligonucleotide analogs such as phosphoramidate morpholino oligonucleotides ( pmo ) might lead to important clinical applications . chemical conjugation of pmo to arginine - rich cell penetrating peptides ( cpp ) such as ( r - ahx - r ) ( 4 ) ( with ahx standing for 6 - aminohexanoic acid ) leads to sequence - specific splicing correction in the absence of endosomolytic agents in cell culture at variance with most conventional cpps . importantly , ( r - ahx - r ) ( 4 ) – pmo conjugates are effective in mouse models of various viral infections and duchenne muscular dystrophy . unfortunately , active doses in some applications might be close to cytotoxic ones thus presenting challenge for systemic administration of the conjugates in those clinical settings . structure – activity relationship studies have thus been undertaken to unravel cpp structural features important for the efficient nuclear delivery of the conjugated pmo and limiting steps in their internalization pathway . affinity for heparin ( taken as a model heparan sulfate ) , hydrophobicity , cellular uptake , intracellular distribution and splicing correction have been monitored . spacing between the charges , hydrophobicity of the linker between the arg - groups and arg - stereochemistry influence splicing correction efficiency . a significant correlation between splicing correction efficiency , affinity for heparin and ability to destabilize model synthetic vesicles has been observed but no correlation with cellular uptake has been found . efforts will have to focus on endosomal escape since it appears to remain the limiting factor for the delivery of these splice - redirecting on analogs ."
immune mechanisms responsible for vaccination against and clearance of mucosal and lymphatic norovirus infection .,"two cardinal manifestations of viral immunity are efficient clearance of acute infection and the capacity to vaccinate against secondary viral exposure . for noroviruses , the contributions of t cells to viral clearance and vaccination have not been elucidated . we report here that both cd4 and cd8 t cells are required for efficient clearance of primary murine norovirus ( mnv ) infection from the intestine and intestinal lymph nodes . further , long - lasting protective immunity was generated by oral live virus vaccination . systemic vaccination with the mnv capsid protein also effectively protected against mucosal challenge , while vaccination with the capsid protein of the distantly related human lordsdale virus provided partial protection . fully effective vaccination required a broad immune response including cd4 t cells , cd8 t cells , and b cells , but the importance of specific immune cell types varied between the intestine and intestinal lymph nodes . perforin , but not interferon gamma , was required for clearance of mnv infection by adoptively transferred t lymphocytes from vaccinated hosts . these studies prove the feasibility of both mucosal and systemic vaccination against mucosal norovirus infection , demonstrate tissue specificity of norovirus immune cells , and indicate that efficient vaccination strategies should induce potent cd4 and cd8 t cell responses ."
self - interest versus group - interest in antiviral control .,"antiviral agents have been hailed to hold considerable promise for the treatment and prevention of emerging viral diseases like h5n1 avian influenza and sars . however , antiviral drugs are not completely harmless , and the conditions under which individuals are willing to participate in a large - scale antiviral drug treatment program are as yet unknown . we provide population dynamical and game theoretical analyses of large - scale prophylactic antiviral treatment programs . throughout we compare the antiviral control strategy that is optimal from the public health perspective with the control strategy that would evolve if individuals make their own , rational decisions . to this end we investigate the conditions under which a large - scale antiviral control program can prevent an epidemic , and we analyze at what point in an unfolding epidemic the risk of infection starts to outweigh the cost of antiviral treatment . this enables investigation of how the optimal control strategy is moulded by the efficacy of antiviral drugs , the risk of mortality by antiviral prophylaxis , and the transmissibility of the pathogen . our analyses show that there can be a strong incentive for an individual to take less antiviral drugs than is optimal from the public health perspective . in particular , when public health asks for early and aggressive control to prevent or curb an emerging pathogen , for the individual antiviral drug treatment is attractive only when the risk of infection has become non-negligible . it is even possible that from a public health perspective a situation in which everybody takes antiviral drugs is optimal , while the process of individual choice leads to a situation where nobody is willing to take antiviral drugs ."
cross-subtype immunity against avian influenza in persons recently vaccinated for influenza .,"avian influenza virus ( h5n1 ) can be transmitted to humans , resulting in a severe or fatal disease . the aim of this study was to evaluate the immune cross-reactivity between human and avian influenza ( h5n1 ) strains in healthy donors vaccinated for seasonal influenza a ( h1n1 ) / ( h3n2 ) . a small frequency of cd4 t cells specific for subtype h5n1 was detected in several persons at baseline , and seasonal vaccine administration enhanced the frequency of such reactive cd4 t cells . we also observed that seasonal vaccination is able to raise neutralizing immunity against influenza ( h5n1 ) in a large number of donors . no correlation between influenza - specific cd4 t cells and humoral responses was observed . n1 may possibly be a target for both cellular and humoral cross-type immunity , but additional experiments are needed to clarify this point . these findings highlight the possibility of boosting cross-type cellular and humoral immunity against highly pathogenic avian influenza a virus subtype h5n1 by seasonal influenza vaccination ."
human bocavirus infections in hospitalized children and adults .,"studies have reported human bocavirus ( hbov ) in children with respiratory tract infections ( rtis ) , but only occasionally in adults . we searched for hbov dna in nasopharyngeal aspirates ( npas ) from adults with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or pneumonia , from children hospitalized for acute rtis , and from asymptomatic children during the winter of 2002 – 2003 in canada . hbov was detected in npas of 1 ( 0.8 % ) of 126 symptomatic adults , 31 ( 13.8 % ) of 225 symptomatic children , and 43 ( 43 % ) of 100 asymptomatic children undergoing elective surgery . another virus was detected in 22 ( 71 % ) of the 31 hbov - positive npas from symptomatic children . two clades of hbov were identified . the pathogenic role of hbov in rtis is uncertain because it was frequently detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic children and was commonly found with other viruses in symptomatic children ."
pandemic influenza planning in the united states from a health disparities perspective .,"we explored how different socioeconomic and racial / ethnic groups in the united states might fare in an influenza pandemic on the basis of social factors that shape exposure , vulnerability to influenza virus , and timeliness and adequacy of treatment . we discuss policies that might differentially affect social groups ’ risk for illness or death . our purpose is not to establish the precise magnitude of disparities likely to occur ; rather , it is to call attention to avoidable disparities that can be expected in the absence of systematic attention to differential social risks in pandemic preparedness plans . policy makers at the federal , state , and local levels should consider potential sources of socioeconomic and racial / ethnic disparities during a pandemic and formulate specific plans to minimize these disparities ."

cost effective strategies for completing the interactome .,"comprehensive protein interaction mapping projects are underway for many model species and humans . a key step in these projects is estimating the time , cost , and personnel required for obtaining an accurate and complete map . here , we model the cost of interaction map completion across a spectrum of experimental designs . we show that current efforts may require up to 20 independent tests covering each protein pair to approach completion . we explore designs for reducing this cost substantially , including prioritization of protein pairs , probability thresholding , and interaction prediction . the best designs lower cost by four-fold overall and > 100-fold in early stages of mapping . we demonstrate the best strategy in an ongoing project in drosophila , in which we map 450 high - confidence interactions using 47 microtiter plates , versus thousands of plates expected using current designs . this study provides a framework for assessing the feasibility of interaction mapping projects and for future efforts to increase their efficiency ."
augmented lung inflammation protects against influenza a pneumonia .,"background : influenza pneumonia causes high mortality every year , and pandemic episodes kill millions of people . influenza - related mortality has been variously ascribed to an ineffective host response that fails to limit viral replication , an excessive host inflammatory response that results in lung injury and impairment of gas exchange , or to bacterial superinfection . we sought to determine whether lung inflammation promoted or impaired host survival in influenza pneumonia . methods and findings : to distinguish among these possible causes of influenza - related death , we induced robust lung inflammation by exposing mice to an aerosolized bacterial lysate prior to challenge with live virus . the treatment induced expression of the inflammatory cytokines il - 6 and tnf in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 8 - and 40-fold greater , respectively , than that caused by lethal influenza infection . yet , this augmented inflammation was associated with striking resistance to host mortality ( 0 % vs 90 % survival , p = 0.0001 ) and reduced viral titers ( p = 0.004 ) . bacterial superinfection of virus infected lungs was not observed . when mice were repeatedly exposed to the bacterial lysate , as would be clinically desirable during an influenza epidemic , there was no tachyphylaxis of the induced viral resistance . when the bacterial lysate was administered after the viral challenge , there was still some mortality benefit , and when ribavirin was added to the aerosolized bacterial lysate , host survival was synergistically improved ( 0 % vs 93.3 % survival , p < 0.0001 ) . conclusions : together , these data indicate that innate immune resistance to influenza can be effectively stimulated , and suggest that ineffective rather than excessive inflammation is the major cause of mortality in influenza pneumonia ."
a novel peptide enhances therapeutic efficacy of liposomal anti-cancer drugs in mice models of human lung cancer .,"lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer - related mortality worldwide . the lack of tumor specificity remains a major drawback for effective chemotherapies and results in dose - limiting toxicities . however , a ligand - mediated drug delivery system should be able to render chemotherapy more specific to tumor cells and less toxic to normal tissues . in this study , we isolated a novel peptide ligand from a phage - displayed peptide library that bound to non-small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) cell lines . the targeting phage bound to several nsclc cell lines but not to normal cells . both the targeting phage and the synthetic peptide recognized the surgical specimens of nsclc with a positive rate of 75 % ( 27 of 36 specimens ) . in severe combined immunodeficiency ( scid ) mice bearing nsclc xenografts , the targeting phage specifically bound to tumor masses . the tumor homing ability of the targeting phage was inhibited by the cognate synthetic peptide , but not by a control or a wty - mutated peptide . when the targeting peptide was coupled to liposomes carrying doxorubicin or vinorelbine , the therapeutic index of the chemotherapeutic agents and the survival rates of mice with human lung cancer xenografts markedly increased . furthermore , the targeting liposomes increased drug accumulation in tumor tissues by 5.7-fold compared with free drugs and enhanced cancer cell apoptosis resulting from a higher concentration of bioavailable doxorubicin . the current study suggests that this tumor - specific peptide may be used to create chemotherapies specifically targeting tumor cells in the treatment of nsclc and to design targeted gene transfer vectors or it may be used one in the diagnosis of this malignancy ."
"il - 1β , il - 6 , and rantes as biomarkers of chikungunya severity .","background : little is known about the immunopathogenesis of chikungunya virus . circulating levels of immune mediators and growth factors were analyzed from patients infected during the first singaporean chikungunya fever outbreak in early 2008 to establish biomarkers associated with infection and / or disease severity . methods and findings : adult patients with laboratory - confirmed chikungunya fever infection , who were referred to the communicable disease centre / tan tock seng hospital during the period from january to february 2008 , were included in this retrospective study . plasma fractions were analyzed using a multiplex - microbead immunoassay . among the patients , the most common clinical features were fever ( 100 % ) , arthralgia ( 90 % ) , rash ( 50 % ) and conjunctivitis ( 40 % ) . profiles of 30 cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors were able to discriminate the clinical forms of chikungunya from healthy controls , with patients classified as non-severe and severe disease . levels of 8 plasma cytokines and 4 growth factors were significantly elevated . statistical analysis showed that an increase in il - 1β , il - 6 and a decrease in rantes were associated with disease severity . conclusions : this is the first comprehensive report on the production of cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors during acute chikungunya virus infection . using these biomarkers , we were able to distinguish between mild disease and more severe forms of chikungunya fever , thus enabling the identification of patients with poor prognosis and monitoring of the disease ."
avian influenza : should china be alarmed ?,"avian influenza has emerged as one of the primary public health concern of the 21st century . influenza strain h5n1 is capable of incidentally infecting humans and other mammals . since their reemergence in 2003 , highly pathogenic avian influenza a ( h5n1 ) viruses have been transmitted from poultry to humans ( by direct or indirect contact with infected birds ) in several provinces of mainland china , which has resulted in 22 cases of human infection and has created repercussions for the chinese economy . people have been concerned whether a new pandemic will occur in the future . the eradication of pathogenic avian influenza viruses appears to be the most effective way to prevent an influenza pandemic . this paper will examine the features of h5n1 , including incidence , infection , immunity , clinical management , prevention and control , and therapy in mainland china ."
rift valley fever virus nss protein promotes post-transcriptional downregulation of protein kinase pkr and inhibits eif2α phosphorylation .,"rift valley fever virus ( rvfv ) ( genus phlebovirus , family bunyaviridae ) is a negative - stranded rna virus with a tripartite genome . rvfv is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans , and fever and high rates of abortions in livestock . a nonstructural rvfv nss protein inhibits the transcription of host mrnas , including interferon - β mrna , and is a major virulence factor . the present study explored a novel function of the rvfv nss protein by testing the replication of rvfv lacking the nss gene in the presence of actinomycin d ( actd ) or α - amanitin , both of which served as a surrogate of the host mrna synthesis suppression function of the nss . in the presence of the host - transcriptional inhibitors , the replication of rvfv lacking the nss protein , but not that carrying nss , induced double - stranded rna - dependent protein kinase ( pkr ) – mediated eukaryotic initiation factor ( eif ) 2α phosphorylation , leading to the suppression of host and viral protein translation . rvfv nss promoted post-transcriptional downregulation of pkr early in the course of the infection and suppressed the phosphorylated eif2α accumulation . these data suggested that a combination of rvfv replication and nss - induced host transcriptional suppression induces pkr - mediated eif2α phosphorylation , while the nss facilitates efficient viral translation by downregulating pkr and inhibiting pkr - mediated eif2α phosphorylation . thus , the two distinct functions of the nss , i.e. , the suppression of host transcription , including that of type i interferon mrnas , and the downregulation of pkr , work together to prevent host innate antiviral functions , allowing efficient replication and survival of rvfv in infected mammalian hosts ."
"influenza virus ( h5n1 ) in live bird markets and food markets , thailand .",a surveillance program for influenza a viruses ( h5n1 ) was conducted in live bird and food markets in central thailand during july 2006 – august 2007 . twelve subtype h5n1 viruses were isolated . the subtype h5n1 viruses circulating in the markets were genetically related to those that circulated in thailand during 2004 – 2005 .
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of cortex magnoliae officinalis and some other medicinal plants commonly used in south - east asia .,"background : eight medicinal plants were tested for their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities . different extraction methods were also tested for their effects on the bioactivities of the medicinal plants . methods : eight plants , namely herba polygonis hydropiperis ( laliaocao ) , folium murraya koenigii ( jialiye ) , rhizoma arachis hypogea ( huashenggen ) , herba houttuyniae ( yuxingcao ) , epipremnum pinnatum ( pashulong ) , rhizoma typhonium flagelliforme ( laoshuyu ) , cortex magnoliae officinalis ( houpo ) and rhizoma imperatae ( baimaogen ) were investigated for their potential antimicrobial and antioxidant properties . results : extracts of cortex magnoliae officinalis had the strongest activities against m. smegmatis , c. albicans , b. subtilis and s. aureus . boiled extracts of cortex magnoliae officinalis , folium murraya koenigii , herba polygonis hydropiperis and herba houttuyniae demonstrated greater antioxidant activities than other tested medicinal plants . conclusion : among the eight tested medicinal plants , cortex magnoliae officinalis showed the highest antimicrobial and antioxidant activities . different methods of extraction yield different spectra of bioactivities ."
results from a hypothesis generating case - control study : herpes family viruses and schizophrenia among military personnel .,"background : herpes family viruses can cause central nervous system inflammatory changes that can present with symptoms indistinguishable from schizophrenia and therefore are of interest in schizophrenia research . most existing studies of herpes viruses have used small populations and postdiagnosis specimens . as part of a larger research program , we conducted a hypothesis - generating case - control study of selected herpes virus antibodies among individuals discharged from the us military with schizophrenia and pre - and postdiagnosis sera . methods : cases ( n = 180 ) were servicemembers hospitalized and discharged from military service with schizophrenia . controls , 3:1 matched on several factors , were members not discharged . the military routinely collects and stores members ' serum specimens . we used microplate enzyme immunoassay to measure immunoglobulin g ( igg ) antibody levels to 6 herpes viruses in pre - and postdiagnosis specimens . conditional logistic regression was used , and the measure of association was the hazard ratio ( hr ) . results : overall , we found a significant association between human herpes virus type 6 and schizophrenia , with an hr of 1.17 ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] = 1.04 , 1.32 ) . women and blacks had significant negative associations with herpes simplex virus type 2 and cytomegalovirus ; among blacks , there was a significant positive association with herpes simplex virus type 1 . among men , there was a hhv - 6 temporal effect with an hr of 1.41 ( 95 % ci = 1.02 , 1.96 ) for sera drawn 6 – 12 months before diagnosis . discussion : findings from previous studies of herpes family viruses and schizophrenia have been inconsistent . our study is based on a larger population than most previous studies and used serum specimens collected before onset of illness . this study adds to the body of knowledge and provides testable hypotheses for follow - on studies ."

the complete genome and proteome of laribacter hongkongensis reveal potential mechanisms for adaptations to different temperatures and habitats .,"laribacter hongkongensis is a newly discovered gram - negative bacillus of the neisseriaceae family associated with freshwater fish – borne gastroenteritis and traveler 's diarrhea . the complete genome sequence of l. hongkongensis hlhk9 , recovered from an immunocompetent patient with severe gastroenteritis , consists of a 3,169 - kb chromosome with g+c content of 62.35 % . genome analysis reveals different mechanisms potentially important for its adaptation to diverse habitats of human and freshwater fish intestines and freshwater environments . the gene contents support its phenotypic properties and suggest that amino acids and fatty acids can be used as carbon sources . the extensive variety of transporters , including multidrug efflux and heavy metal transporters as well as genes involved in chemotaxis , may enable l. hongkongensis to survive in different environmental niches . genes encoding urease , bile salts efflux pump , adhesin , catalase , superoxide dismutase , and other putative virulence factors — such as hemolysins , rtx toxins , patatin - like proteins , phospholipase a1 , and collagenases — are present . proteomes of l. hongkongensis hlhk9 cultured at 37 °c ( human body temperature ) and 20 °c ( freshwater habitat temperature ) showed differential gene expression , including two homologous copies of argb , argb - 20 , and argb - 37 , which encode two isoenzymes of n - acetyl - l - glutamate kinase ( nagk ) — nagk - 20 and nagk - 37 — in the arginine biosynthesis pathway . nagk - 20 showed higher expression at 20 °c , whereas nagk - 37 showed higher expression at 37 °c . nagk - 20 also had a lower optimal temperature for enzymatic activities and was inhibited by arginine probably as negative - feedback control . similar duplicated copies of argb are also observed in bacteria from hot springs such as thermus thermophilus , deinococcus geothermalis , deinococcus radiodurans , and roseiflexus castenholzii , suggesting that similar mechanisms for temperature adaptation may be employed by other bacteria . genome and proteome analysis of l. hongkongensis revealed novel mechanisms for adaptations to survival at different temperatures and habitats ."
malignant mesothelioma .,"malignant mesothelioma is a fatal asbestos - associated malignancy originating from the lining cells ( mesothelium ) of the pleural and peritoneal cavities , as well as the pericardium and the tunica vaginalis . the exact prevalence is unknown but it is estimated that mesotheliomas represent less than 1 % of all cancers . its incidence is increasing , with an expected peak in the next 10 – 20 years . pleural malignant mesothelioma is the most common form of mesothelioma . typical presenting features are those of chest pain and dyspnoea . breathlessness due to a pleural effusion without chest pain is reported in about 30 % of patients . a chest wall mass , weight loss , sweating , abdominal pain and ascites ( due to peritoneal involvement ) are less common presentations . mesothelioma is directly attributable to occupational asbestos exposure with a history of exposure in over 90 % of cases . there is also evidence that mesothelioma may result from both para-occupational exposure and non-occupational "" environmental "" exposure . idiopathic or spontaneous mesothelioma can also occur in the absence of any exposure to asbestos , with a spontaneous rate in humans of around one per million . a combination of accurate exposure history , along with examination radiology and pathology are essential to make the diagnosis . distinguishing malignant from benign pleural disease can be challenging . the most helpful ct findings suggesting malignant pleural disease are 1 ) a circumferential pleural rind , 2 ) nodular pleural thickening , 3 ) pleural thickening of > 1 cm and 4 ) mediastinal pleural involvement . involvement of a multidisciplinary team is recommended to ensure prompt and appropriate management , using a framework of radiotherapy , chemotherapy , surgery and symptom palliation with end of life care . compensation issues must also be considered . life expectancy in malignant mesothelioma is poor , with a median survival of about one year following diagnosis ."
antiviral resistance during pandemic influenza : implications for stockpiling and drug use .,"background : the anticipated extent of antiviral use during an influenza pandemic can have adverse consequences for the development of drug resistance and rationing of limited stockpiles . the strategic use of drugs is therefore a major public health concern in planning for effective pandemic responses . methods : we employed a mathematical model that includes both sensitive and resistant strains of a virus with pandemic potential , and applies antiviral drugs for treatment of clinical infections . using estimated parameters in the published literature , the model was simulated for various sizes of stockpiles to evaluate the outcome of different antiviral strategies . results : we demonstrated that the emergence of highly transmissible resistant strains has no significant impact on the use of available stockpiles if treatment is maintained at low levels or the reproduction number of the sensitive strain is sufficiently high . however , moderate to high treatment levels can result in a more rapid depletion of stockpiles , leading to run - out , by promoting wide - spread drug resistance . we applied an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak . our results show that if high treatment levels are enforced too early during the outbreak , a second wave of infections can potentially occur with a substantially larger magnitude . however , a timely implementation of wide - scale treatment can prevent resistance spread in the population , and minimize the final size of the pandemic . conclusion : our results reveal that conservative treatment levels during the early stages of the outbreak , followed by a timely increase in the scale of drug - use , will offer an effective strategy to manage drug resistance in the population and avoid run - out . for a 1918 - like strain , the findings suggest that pandemic plans should consider stockpiling antiviral drugs to cover at least 20 % of the population ."
transmission dynamics and prospects for the elimination of canine rabies .,"rabies has been eliminated from domestic dog populations in western europe and north america , but continues to kill many thousands of people throughout africa and asia every year . a quantitative understanding of transmission dynamics in domestic dog populations provides critical information to assess whether global elimination of canine rabies is possible . we report extensive observations of individual rabid animals in tanzania and generate a uniquely detailed analysis of transmission biology , which explains important epidemiological features , including the level of variation in epidemic trajectories . we found that the basic reproductive number for rabies , r ( 0 ) , is very low in our study area in rural africa ( ∼ 1.2 ) and throughout its historic global range ( < 2 ) . this finding provides strong support for the feasibility of controlling endemic canine rabies by vaccination , even near wildlife areas with large wild carnivore populations . however , we show that rapid turnover of domestic dog populations has been a major obstacle to successful control in developing countries , thus regular pulse vaccinations will be required to maintain population - level immunity between campaigns . nonetheless our analyses suggest that with sustained , international commitment , global elimination of rabies from domestic dog populations , the most dangerous vector to humans , is a realistic goal ."
detection of genetically modified organisms ( gmos ) using isothermal amplification of target dna sequences .,"background : the most common method of gmo detection is based upon the amplification of gmo - specific dna amplicons using the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) . here we have applied the loop - mediated isothermal amplification ( lamp ) method to amplify gmo - related dna sequences , ' internal ' commonly - used motifs for controlling transgene expression and event - specific ( plant - transgene ) junctions . results : we have tested the specificity and sensitivity of the technique for use in gmo studies . results show that detection of 0.01 % gmo in equivalent background dna was possible and dilutions of template suggest that detection from single copies of the template may be possible using lamp . conclusion : this work shows that gmo detection can be carried out using lamp for routine screening as well as for specific events detection . moreover , the sensitivity and ability to amplify targets , even with a high background of dna , here demonstrated , highlights the advantages of this isothermal amplification when applied for gmo detection ."
multivalent ha dna vaccination protects against highly pathogenic h5n1 avian influenza infection in chickens and mice .,"background : sustained outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza ( hpai ) h5n1 in avian species increase the risk of reassortment and adaptation to humans . the ability to contain its spread in chickens would reduce this threat and help maintain the capacity for egg - based vaccine production . while vaccines offer the potential to control avian disease , a major concern of current vaccines is their potency and inability to protect against evolving avian influenza viruses . methodology / principal findings : the ability of dna vaccines encoding hemagglutinin ( ha ) proteins from different hpai h5n1 serotypes was evaluated for its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies and to protect against homologous and heterologous hpai h5n1 strain challenge in mice and chickens after dna immunization by needle and syringe or with a pressure injection device . these vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized multiple strains of hpai h5n1 when given in combinations containing up to 10 has . the response was dose - dependent , and breadth was determined by the choice of the influenza virus ha in the vaccine . monovalent and trivalent ha vaccines were tested first in mice and conferred protection against lethal h5n1 a / vietnam / 1203/2004 challenge 68 weeks after vaccination . in chickens , protection was observed against heterologous strains of hpai h5n1 after vaccination with a trivalent h5 serotype dna vaccine with doses as low as 5 µg dna given twice either by intramuscular needle injection or with a needle - free device . conclusions / significance : dna vaccines offer a generic approach to influenza virus immunization applicable to multiple animal species . in addition , the ability to substitute plasmids encoding different strains enables rapid adaptation of the vaccine to newly evolving field isolates ."
virus - specific read - through codon preference affects infectivity of chimeric cucumber green mottle mosaic viruses displaying a dengue virus epitope .,"a cucumber green mottle mosaic virus ( cgmmv ) was used to present a truncated dengue virus type 2 envelope ( e ) protein binding region from amino acids 379 to 423 ( eb4 ) . the eb4 gene was inserted at the terminal end of the cgmmv coat protein ( cp ) open reading frame ( orf ) . read - through sequences of tmv or cgmmv , caa - uag - caa - uua , or aaa - uag - caa - uua were , respectively , inserted in between the cp and the eb4 genes . the chimeric clones , prt , prg , and pcg + fsrtre , were transcribed into full - length capped recombinant cgmmv transcripts . only constructs with the wild - type cgmmv read - through sequence yielded infectious viruses following infection of host plant , muskmelon ( cucumis melo ) leaves . the ratio of modified to unmodified cp for the read - through expression clone developed was also found to be approximately 1:1 , higher than what has been previously reported . it was also observed that infectivity was not affected by differences in pi between the chimera and its wild counterpart . analysis of recombinant viruses after 21 - days - postinculation ( dpi ) revealed that deletions occurred resulting in partial reversions of the viral population to near wild type and suggesting that this would be the limiting harvest period for obtaining true to type recombinants with this construct ."
enhanced hygiene measures and norovirus transmission during an outbreak .,"control of norovirus outbreaks relies on enhanced hygiene measures , such as handwashing , surface cleaning , using disposable paper towels , and using separate toilets for sick and well persons . however , little is known about their effectiveness in limiting further spread of norovirus infections . we analyzed norovirus outbreaks in 7 camps at an international scouting jamboree in the netherlands during 2004 . implementation of hygiene measures coincided with an 84.8 % ( 95 % predictive interval 81.2 % – 86.6 % ) reduction in reproduction number . this reduction was unexpectedly large but still below the reduction needed to contain a norovirus outbreak . even more stringent control measures are required to break the chain of transmission of norovirus ."

on the significance of surfactant protein - a within the human lungs .,"surfactant protein - a ( sp - a ) is the most prominent among four proteins in the pulmonary surfactant - system . sp - a is expressed by alveolar epithelial cells type ii as well as by a portion of non small cell lung carcinomas ( nsclc ) . the expression of sp - a is complexly regulated on the transcriptional and the chromosomal level . sp - a is a major player in the pulmonary cytokine - network and moreover has been described to act in the pulmonary host defense . by the use of cell culture or animal models the functional properties have been repeatedly shown in many aspects , often bearing surprising properties which strongly indicate the physiological importance of sp - a. to date sp - a is recognized as a molecule essential for pulmonary development , structure and function . an upcoming number of reports deals with the role of sp - a for pulmonary pathology . this article gives an overview about the state of knowledge on sp - a focused in applications for human pulmonary disorders and points out the importance for pathology - orientated research approaches using immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization as promising methods to further elucidate the role of this molecule in adult lung diseases ."
proteolytic processing of a precursor protein for a growth - promoting peptide by a subtilisin serine protease in arabidopsis .,"phytosulfokines ( psks ) are secreted , sulfated peptide hormones derived from larger prepropeptide precursors . proteolytic processing of one of the precursors , atpsk4 , was demonstrated by cleavage of a preproatpsk4 – myc transgene product to atpsk4 – myc . cleavage of proatpsk4 was induced by placing root explants in tissue culture . the processing of proatpsk4 was dependent on atsbt1 .1 , a subtilisin - like serine protease , encoded by one of 56 subtilase genes in arabidopsis . the gene encoding atsbt1 .1 was up - regulated following the transfer of root explants to tissue culture , suggesting that activation of the proteolytic machinery that cleaves proatpsk4 is dependent on atsbt1 .1 expression . we also demonstrated that a fluorogenic peptide representing the putative subtilase recognition site in proatpsk4 is cleaved in vitro by affinity - purified atsbt1 .1 . an alanine scan through the recognition site peptide indicated that atsbt1 .1 is fairly specific for the atpsk4 precursor . thus , this peptide growth factor , which promotes callus formation in culture , is proteolytically cleaved from its precursor by a specific plant subtilase encoded by a gene that is up - regulated during the process of transfering root explants to tissue culture ."
protein domain boundary predictions : a structural biology perspective .,"one of the important fields to apply computational tools for domain boundaries prediction is structural biology . they can be used to design protein constructs that must be expressed in a stable and functional form and must produce diffraction - quality crystals . however , prediction of protein domain boundaries on the basis of amino acid sequences is still very problematical . in present study the performance of several computational approaches are compared . it is observed that the statistical significance of most of the predictions is rather poor . nevertheless , when the right number of domains is correctly predicted , domain boundaries are predicted within very few residues from their real location . it can be concluded that prediction methods can not be used yet as routine tools in structural biology , though some of them are rather promising ."
enhancing time - series detection algorithms for automated biosurveillance .,"biosense is a us national system that uses data from health information systems for automated disease surveillance . we studied 4 time - series algorithm modifications designed to improve sensitivity for detecting artificially added data . to test these modified algorithms , we used reports of daily syndrome visits from 308 department of defense ( dod ) facilities and 340 hospital emergency departments ( eds ) . at a constant alert rate of 1 % , sensitivity was improved for both datasets by using a minimum standard deviation ( sd ) of 1.0 , a 14 – 28 day baseline duration for calculating mean and sd , and an adjustment for total clinic visits as a surrogate denominator . stratifying baseline days into weekdays versus weekends to account for day - of - week effects increased sensitivity for the dod data but not for the ed data . these enhanced methods may increase sensitivity without increasing the alert rate and may improve the ability to detect outbreaks by using automated surveillance system data ."
molecular mechanisms of recombination restriction in the envelope gene of the human immunodeficiency virus .,"the ability of pathogens to escape the host 's immune response is crucial for the establishment of persistent infections and can influence virulence . recombination has been observed to contribute to this process by generating novel genetic variants . although distinctive recombination patterns have been described in many viral pathogens , little is known about the influence of biases in the recombination process itself relative to selective forces acting on newly formed recombinants . understanding these influences is important for determining how recombination contributes to pathogen genome and proteome evolution . most previous research on recombination - driven protein evolution has focused on relatively simple proteins , usually in the context of directed evolution experiments . here , we study recombination in the envelope gene of hiv - 1 between primary isolates belonging to subtypes that recombine naturally in the hiv / aids pandemic . by characterizing the early steps in the generation of recombinants , we provide novel insights into the evolutionary forces that shape recombination patterns within viral populations . specifically , we show that the combined effects of mechanistic processes that determine the locations of recombination breakpoints across the hiv - 1 envelope gene , and purifying selection acting against dysfunctional recombinants , can explain almost the entire distribution of breakpoints found within this gene in nature . these constraints account for the surprising paucity of recombination breakpoints found in infected individuals within this highly variable gene . thus , the apparent randomness of hiv evolution via recombination may in fact be relatively more predictable than anticipated . in addition , the dominance of purifying selection in localized areas of the hiv genome defines regions where functional constraints on recombinants appear particularly strong , pointing to vulnerable aspects of hiv biology ."
avian influenza virus glycoproteins restrict virus replication and spread through human airway epithelium at temperatures of the proximal airways .,"transmission of avian influenza viruses from bird to human is a rare event even though avian influenza viruses infect the ciliated epithelium of human airways in vitro and ex vivo . using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium ( hae ) , we demonstrate that while human and avian influenza viruses efficiently infect at temperatures of the human distal airways ( 37 °c ) , avian , but not human , influenza viruses are restricted for infection at the cooler temperatures of the human proximal airways ( 32 °c ) . these data support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses , ordinarily adapted to the temperature of the avian enteric tract ( 40 °c ) , rarely infect humans , in part due to differences in host airway regional temperatures . previously , a critical residue at position 627 in the avian influenza virus polymerase subunit , pb2 , was identified as conferring temperature - dependency in mammalian cells . here , we use reverse genetics to show that avianization of residue 627 attenuates a human virus , but does not account for the different infection between 32 °c and 37 °c . to determine the mechanism of temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses in hae at 32 °c , we generated recombinant human influenza viruses in either the a / victoria / 3/75 ( h3n2 ) or a / pr / 8/34 ( h1n1 ) genetic background that contained avian or avian - like glycoproteins . two of these viruses , a / victoria / 3/75 with l226q and s228g mutations in hemagglutinin ( ha ) and neuraminidase ( na ) from a / chick / italy / 1347/99 and a / pr / 8/34 containing the h7 and n1 from a / chick / italy / 1347/99 , exhibited temperature restriction approaching that of wholly avian influenza viruses . these data suggest that influenza viruses bearing avian or avian - like surface glycoproteins have a reduced capacity to establish productive infection at the temperature of the human proximal airways . this temperature restriction may limit zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses and suggests that adaptation of avian influenza viruses to efficient infection at 32 °c may represent a critical evolutionary step enabling human - to - human transmission ."
a multidimensional classification of public health activity in australia .,"background : at present , we have very limited ability to compare public health activity across jurisdictions and countries , or even to ascertain differences in what is considered to be a public health activity . existing standardised health classifications do not capture important dimensions of public health , which include its functions , the methods and interventions used to achieve these , the health issues and determinants of health that public health activities address , the resources and infrastructure they use , and the settings in which they occur . a classification that describes these dimensions will promote consistency in collecting and reporting information about public health programs , expenditure , workforce and performance . this paper describes the development of an initial version of such a classification . methods : we used open - source protégé software and published procedures to construct an ontology of public health , which forms the basis of the classification . we reviewed existing definitions of public health , descriptions of public health functions and classifications to develop the scope , domain , and multidimensional class structure of the ontology . these were then refined through a series of consultations with public health experts from across australia , culminating in an initial classification framework . results : the public health classification consists of six top - level classes : public health ' functions ' ; ' health issues ' ; ' determinants of health ' ; ' settings ' ; ' methods ' of intervention ; and ' resources and infrastructure ' . existing classifications ( such as the international classifications of diseases , disability and functioning and external causes of injuries ) can be used to further classify large parts of the classes ' health issues ' , ' settings ' and ' resources and infrastructure ' , while new subclass structures are proposed for the classes of public health ' functions ' , ' determinants of health ' and ' interventions ' . conclusion : the public health classification captures the important dimensions of public health activity . it will facilitate the organisation of information so that it can be used to address questions relating to any of these dimensions , either singly or in combination . the authors encourage readers to use the classification , and to suggest improvements ."
small interfering rna targeting m2 gene induces effective and long term inhibition of influenza a virus replication .,"rna interference ( rnai ) provides a powerful new means to inhibit viral infection specifically . however , the selection of sirna - resistant viruses is a major concern in the use of rnai as antiviral therapeutics . in this study , we conducted a lentiviral vector with a h1 - short hairpin rna ( shrna ) expression cassette to deliver small interfering rnas ( sirnas ) into mammalian cells . using this vector that also expresses enhanced green fluorescence protein ( egfp ) as surrogate marker , stable shrna - expressing cell lines were successfully established and the inhibition efficiencies of rationally designed sirnas targeting to conserved regions of influenza a virus genome were assessed . the results showed that a sirna targeting influenza m2 gene ( sim2 ) potently inhibited viral replication . the sim2 was not only effective for h1n1 virus but also for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus h5n1 . in addition to its m2 inhibition , the sim2 also inhibited np mrna accumulation and protein expression . a long term inhibition effect of the sim2 was demonstrated and the emergence of sirna - resistant mutants in influenza quasispecies was not observed . taken together , our study suggested that m2 gene might be an optimal rnai target for antiviral therapy . these findings provide useful information for the development of rnai - based prophylaxis and therapy for human influenza virus infection ."
increased expression levels of the pvcrt - o and pvmdr1 genes in a patient with severe plasmodium vivax malaria .,"background : there are increasing reports of severe clinical cases exclusively associated with plasmodium vivax infections . notably , this severity has been recently suggested to be associated with chloroquine resistance . patients : two different patients presented at the hospital clinic in barcelona with p. vivax malaria episodes . one patient had severe symptoms and the other mild symptoms . both patients traveled through the brazilian amazon ( manaus ) in 2007 . for both patients the current diagnosis of malaria was the first . two other patients with mild symptoms presented to the "" centro de pesquisa em medicina tropical "" , also in the brazilian amazon ( rondônia ) in 2000 . methods : to exclude the possibility that the patient 's severe symptoms were due to plasmodium falciparum , a nested pcr was performed . a magnetic method was used to purify p. vivax free of human leukocytes . quantitative real - time pcr was performed to compare the transcript levels of two main transporters likely to be involved in chloroquine resistance in p. vivax , namely the p. vivax chloroquine resistance transporter , pvcrt - o , and the p. vivax multidrug resistance transporter , pvmdr 1 . results : results demonstrated that the severe clinical symptoms were exclusively due to p. vivax . the patient presented acute respiratory conditions requiring admission to the intensive care unit . the magnetic method showed highly purified infected - reticulocytes with mature stages . in addition , it was found that parasites obtained from the severe patient had up to 2.9-fold increase in pvmdr1 levels and up to 21.9-fold increase in pvcrt - o levels compared to expression levels of parasites from the other patients with mild symptoms . conclusion : this is the first clinical case of severe disease exclusively associated with vivax malaria in spain . moreover , these findings suggest that clinical severity could be associated with increased expression levels of parasite genes likely involved in chloroquine resistance . it is necessary to further explore the potential of pvmdr1 and particularly pvcrt - o expression levels as molecular markers of severe disease in p. vivax ."
health workers ' views on quality of prevention of mother - to - child transmission and postnatal care for hiv - infected women and their children .,"background : prevention of mother - to - child transmission has been considered as not a simple intervention but a comprehensive set of interventions requiring capable health workers . viet nam 's extensive health care system reaches the village level , but still hiv - infected mothers and children have received inadequate health care services for prevention of mother - to - child transmission . we report here the health workers ' perceptions on factors that lead to their failure to give good quality prevention of mother - to - child transmission services . methods : semistructured interviews with 53 health workers and unstructured observations in nine health facilities in hanoi were conducted . selection of respondents was based on their function , position and experience in the development or implementation of prevention of mother - to - child transmission policies / programmes . results : factors that lead to health workers ' failure to give good quality services for prevention of mother - to - child transmission include their own fear of hiv infection ; lack of knowledge on hiv and counselling skills ; or high workloads and lack of staff ; unavailability of hiv testing at commune level ; shortage of antiretroviral drugs ; and lack of operational guidelines . a negative attitude during counselling and provision of care , treating in a separate area and avoidance of providing service at all were seen by health workers as the result of fear of being infected , as well as distrust towards almost all hiv - infected patients because of the prevailing association with antisocial behaviours . additionally , the fragmentation of the health care system into specialized vertical pillars , including a vertical programme for hiv / aids , is a major obstacle to providing a continuum of care . conclusion : many hospital staff were not being able to provide good care or were even unwilling to provide appropriate care for hiv - positive pregnant women the study suggests that the quality of prevention of mother - to - child transmission service could be enhanced by improving communication and other skills of health workers , providing them with greater support and enhancing their motivation . reduction of workload would also be important . development of a practical strategy is needed to strengthen and adapt the referral system to meet the needs of patients ."
inhibition of lassa virus glycoprotein cleavage and multicycle replication by site 1 protease - adapted α ( 1 ) - antitrypsin variants .,"background : proteolytic processing of the lassa virus envelope glycoprotein precursor gp - c by the host proprotein convertase site 1 protease ( s1p ) is a prerequisite for the incorporation of the subunits gp - 1 and gp - 2 into viral particles and , hence , essential for infectivity and virus spread . therefore , we tested in this study the concept of using s1p as a target to block efficient virus replication . methodology / principal finding : we demonstrate that stable cell lines inducibly expressing s1p - adapted α ( 1 ) - antitrypsin variants inhibit the proteolytic maturation of gp - c. introduction of the s1p recognition motifs rril and rrll into the reactive center loop of α ( 1 ) - antitrypsin resulted in abrogation of gp - c processing by endogenous s1p to a similar level observed in s1p - deficient cells . moreover , s1p - specific α ( 1 ) - antitrypsins significantly inhibited replication and spread of a replication - competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the lassa virus glycoprotein gp as well as authentic lassa virus . inhibition of viral replication correlated with the ability of the different α ( 1 ) - antitrypsin variants to inhibit the processing of the lassa virus glycoprotein precursor . conclusions / significance : our data suggest that glycoprotein cleavage by s1p is a promising target for the development of novel anti-arenaviral strategies ."
virhostnet : a knowledge base for the management and the analysis of proteome - wide virus – host interaction networks .,"infectious diseases caused by viral agents kill millions of people every year . the improvement of prevention and treatment of viral infections and their associated diseases remains one of the main public health challenges . towards this goal , deciphering virus – host molecular interactions opens new perspectives to understand the biology of infection and for the design of new antiviral strategies . indeed , modelling of an infection network between viral and cellular proteins will provide a conceptual and analytic framework to efficiently formulate new biological hypothesis at the proteome scale and to rationalize drug discovery . therefore , we present the first release of virhostnet ( virus – host network ) , a public knowledge base specialized in the management and analysis of integrated virus – virus , virus – host and host – host interaction networks coupled to their functional annotations . virhostnet integrates an extensive and original literature - curated dataset of virus – virus and virus – host interactions ( 2671 non-redundant interactions ) representing more than 180 distinct viral species and one of the largest human interactome ( 10 672 proteins and 68 252 non-redundant interactions ) reconstructed from publicly available data . the virhostnet web interface provides appropriate tools that allow efficient query and visualization of this infected cellular network . public access to the virhostnet knowledge - based system is available at http://pbildb1.univ-lyon1.fr/virhostnet ."
rfam : updates to the rna families database .,"rfam is a collection of rna sequence families , represented by multiple sequence alignments and covariance models ( cms ) . the primary aim of rfam is to annotate new members of known rna families on nucleotide sequences , particularly complete genomes , using sensitive blast filters in combination with cms . a minority of families with a very broad taxonomic range ( e.g. trna and rrna ) provide the majority of the sequence annotations , whilst the majority of rfam families ( e.g. snornas and mirnas ) have a limited taxonomic range and provide a limited number of annotations . recent improvements to the website , methodologies and data used by rfam are discussed . rfam is freely available on the web at http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/and http://rfam.janelia.org/ ."
new respiratory enterovirus and recombinant rhinoviruses among circulating picornaviruses .,"rhinoviruses and enteroviruses are leading causes of respiratory infections . to evaluate genotypic diversity and identify forces shaping picornavirus evolution , we screened persons with respiratory illnesses by using rhinovirus - specific or generic real - time pcr assays . we then sequenced the 5 ′ untranslated region , capsid protein vp1 , and protease precursor 3cd regions of virus - positive samples . subsequent phylogenetic analysis identified the large genotypic diversity of rhinoviruses circulating in humans . we identified and completed the genome sequence of a new enterovirus genotype associated with respiratory symptoms and acute otitis media , confirming the close relationship between rhinoviruses and enteroviruses and the need to detect both viruses in respiratory specimens . finally , we identified recombinants among circulating rhinoviruses and mapped their recombination sites , thereby demonstrating that rhinoviruses can recombine in their natural host . this study clarifies the diversity and explains the reasons for evolution of these viruses ."
low - cost hiv - 1 diagnosis and quantification in dried blood spots by real time pcr .,"background : rapid and cost - effective methods for hiv - 1 diagnosis and viral load monitoring would greatly enhance the clinical management of hiv - 1 infected adults and children in limited - resource settings . recent recommendations to treat perinatally infected infants within the first year of life are feasible only if early diagnosis is routinely available . dried blood spots ( dbs ) on filter paper are an easy and convenient way to collect and transport blood samples . a rapid and cost effective method to diagnose and quantify hiv - 1 from dbs is urgently needed to facilitate early diagnosis of hiv - 1 infection and monitoring of antiretroviral therapy . methods and findings : we have developed a real - time lightcycler ( rtlc ) pcr assay to detect and quantify hiv - 1 from dbs . hiv - 1 rna extracted from dbs was amplified in a one - step , single - tube system using primers specific for long - terminal repeat sequences that are conserved across all hiv - 1 clades . sybr green dye was used to quantify pcr amplicons and hiv - 1 rna copy numbers were determined from a standard curve generated using serially diluted known copies of hiv - 1 rna . this assay detected samples across clades , has a dynamic range of 5 log ( 10 ) , and % cv < 8 % up to 4 log ( 10 ) dilution . plasma hiv - 1 rna copy numbers obtained using this method correlated well with the roche ultrasensitive ( r = 0.91 ) and branched dna ( r = 0.89 ) assays . the lower limit of detection ( 95 % ) was estimated to be 136 copies . the rtlc dbs assay was 2.5 fold rapid as well as 40-fold cheaper when compared to commercial assays . adaptation of the assay into other real - time systems demonstrated similar performance . conclusions : the accuracy , reliability , genotype inclusivity and affordability , along with the small volumes of blood required for the assay suggest that the rtlc dbs assay will be useful for early diagnosis and monitoring of pediatric hiv - 1 infection in resource - limited settings ."
a statistical framework for the adaptive management of epidemiological interventions .,"background : epidemiological interventions aim to control the spread of infectious disease through various mechanisms , each carrying a different associated cost . methodology : we describe a flexible statistical framework for generating optimal epidemiological interventions that are designed to minimize the total expected cost of an emerging epidemic while simultaneously propagating uncertainty regarding the underlying disease model parameters through to the decision process . the strategies produced through this framework are adaptive : vaccination schedules are iteratively adjusted to reflect the anticipated trajectory of the epidemic given the current population state and updated parameter estimates . conclusions : using simulation studies based on a classic influenza outbreak , we demonstrate the advantages of adaptive interventions over non-adaptive ones , in terms of cost and resource efficiency , and robustness to model misspecification ."
bench - to - bedside review : angiopoietin signalling in critical illness – a future target ?,"multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( mods ) occurs in response to major insults such as sepsis , severe haemorrhage , trauma , major surgery and pancreatitis . the mortality rate is high despite intensive supportive care . the pathophysiological mechanism underlying mods are not entirely clear , although several have been proposed . overwhelming inflammation , immunoparesis , occult oxygen debt and other mechanisms have been investigated , and – despite many unanswered questions – therapies targeting these mechanisms have been developed . unfortunately , only a few interventions , usually those targeting multiple mechanisms at the same time , have appeared to be beneficial . we clearly need to understand better the mechanisms that underlie mods . the endothelium certainly plays an active role in mods . it functions at the intersection of several systems , including inflammation , coagulation , haemodynamics , fluid and electrolyte balance , and cell migration . an important regulator of these systems is the angiopoietin / tie2 signalling system . in this review we describe this signalling system , giving special attention to what is known about it in critically ill patients and its potential as a target for therapy ."
mapping the sequence mutations of the 2009 h1n1 influenza a virus neuraminidase relative to drug and antibody binding sites .,"in this work , we study the consequences of sequence variations of the "" 2009 h1n1 "" ( swine or mexican flu ) influenza a virus strain neuraminidase for drug treatment and vaccination . we find that it is phylogenetically more closely related to european h1n1 swine flu and h5n1 avian flu rather than to the h1n1 counterparts in the americas . homology - based 3d structure modeling reveals that the novel mutations are preferentially located at the protein surface and do not interfere with the active site . the latter is the binding cavity for 3 currently used neuraminidase inhibitors : oseltamivir ( tamiflu ( ® ) ) , zanamivir ( relenza ( ® ) ) and peramivir ; thus , the drugs should remain effective for treatment . however , the antigenic regions of the neuraminidase relevant for vaccine development , serological typing and passive antibody treatment can differ from those of previous strains and already vary among patients . this article was reviewed by sandor pongor and l. aravind ."
development of taqman ( ® ) mgb fluorescent real - time pcr assay for the detection of anatid herpesvirus 1 .,"background : anatid herpesvirus 1 ( ahv - 1 ) is an alphaherpesvirus associated with latent infection and mortality in ducks and geese and is currently affecting the world - wide waterfowl production severely . here we describe a fluorescent quantitative real - time pcr ( fq - pcr ) method developed for fast measurement of ahv - 1 dna based on taqman mgb technology . results : the detection limit of the assay was 1 × 10 ( 1 ) standard dna copies , with a sensitivity of 2 logs higher than that of the conventional gel - based pcr assay targeting the same gene . the real - time pcr was reproducible , as shown by satisfactory low intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation . conclusion : the high sensitivity , specificity , simplicity and reproducibility of the ahv - 1 fluorogenic pcr assay , combined with its wide dynamic range and high throughput , make this method suitable for a broad spectrum of ahv - 1 etiologically related application ."
role of nitric oxide in management of acute respiratory distress syndrome .,"the current mortality rate of patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) is between 45 % and 92 % , with most dying within the first two weeks of the illness . in an effort to combat such an alarmingly high mortality rate , various treatment therapies such as low tidal volume ventilation strategies , corticosteroid therapy , and use of nitric oxide ( no ) have been attempted in the management of patients with ards . three cases which were admitted to the icu and confirmed to have ards were unable to be weaned from ventilatory support , and nitric oxide therapy was initiated . it improved patients ' oxygenation for short periods of time but did not affect the mortality . the patients could not be weaned from the ventilator and expired ."
avian influenza : the tip of the iceberg .,"for some years now , we have been living with the fear of an impending pandemic of avian influenza ( ai ) . despite the recognition , in 1996 , of the global threat posed by the highly pathogenic h5n1 influenza virus found in farmed geese in guangdong province , china , planning for the anticipated epidemic remains woefully inadequate ; this is especially true in developing countries such as saudi arabia . these deficiencies became obvious in 1997 , with the outbreak of ai in the live animal markets in hong kong that led to the transmission of infection to 18 humans with close contact with diseased birds ; there were six reported deaths . [ 1 ] in 2003 , with the reemergence of h5n1 ( considered the most likely ai virus ) in the republic of korea and its subsequent spread to thailand , vietnam , hong kong and china . many countries started aggressively making preparations to meet the threat . [ 2 ] the pressure for real action from governments has increased . most developed countries have requested increased funding for the search for a more effective vaccine , for stockpiling possibly helpful antiviral drugs , and for intensifying domestic and global surveillance . [ 3 ] most countries , however , continue to be inadequately prepared for such an epidemic , especially with regard to animal surveillance in the farm market and surveillance among migratory birds . even now , most countries do not have the ability to detect disease among humans in the early stages of an outbreak nor do most hospitals comply with effective infection control measures that could curtail the spread of the virus in the early stages of an epidemic . in saudi arabia we are rapidly implementing many of these measures .

the y271 and i274 amino acids in reverse transcriptase of human immunodeficiency virus - 1 are critical to protein stability .,"reverse transcriptase ( rt ) of human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) - 1 plays a key role in initiating viral replication and is an important target for developing anti-hiv drugs . our previous study showed that two mutations ( y271a and i274a ) in the turn rt ( gln ( 269 ) - arg ( 277 ) ) abrogated viral replication , but the replication capacity and rt activity was discordant . in this study , we further investigated why alanine substitutions at these two sites would affect viral replication . we found that both rt activity and rt protein were almost undetectable in viral particles of these two mutants , although the pr160 ( gag - pol ) mutants were properly expressed , transported and incorporated . using protease inhibition assay , we demonstrated a correlation between the degradation of the rt mutants and the activity of viral protease . our native gel analysis indicated that the mutations at 271 and 274 amino acids might cause conformational changes , leading to the formation of higher order oligomers instead of dimers , resulting in increased protein instability and susceptibility to viral protease . thus , residues 271 and 274 are critical to rt stability and resistance to viral protease . the conservation of the two amino acid residues among different strains of hiv - 1 lent further support to this conclusion . the knowledge gained here may prove useful in drug design ."

"remission of invasive , cancer stem - like glioblastoma xenografts using lentiviral vector - mediated suicide gene therapy .","background : glioblastoma is the most frequent and most malignant primary brain tumor with a poor prognosis . the translation of therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma from the experimental phase into the clinic has been limited by insufficient animal models , which lack important features of human tumors . lentiviral gene therapy is an attractive therapeutic option for human glioblastoma , which we validated in a clinically relevant animal model . methodology / principal findings : we used a rodent xenograft model that recapitulates the invasive and angiogenic features of human glioblastoma to analyze the transduction pattern and therapeutic efficacy of lentiviral pseudotyped vectors . both , lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein ( lcmv - gp ) and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein ( vsv - g ) pseudotyped lentiviral vectors very efficiently transduced human glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo . in contrast , pseudotyped gammaretroviral vectors , similar to those evaluated for clinical therapy of glioblastoma , showed inefficient gene transfer in vitro and in vivo . both pseudotyped lentiviral vectors transduced cancer stem - like cells characterized by their cd133 - , nestin - and sox2 - expression , the ability to form spheroids in neural stem cell medium and to express astrocytic and neuronal differentiation markers under serum conditions . in a therapeutic approach using the suicide gene herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase ( hsv -1-tk ) fused to egfp , both lentiviral vectors mediated a complete remission of solid tumors as seen on mri resulting in a highly significant survival benefit ( p < 0.001 ) compared to control groups . in all recurrent tumors , surviving egfp - positive tumor cells were found , advocating prodrug application for several cycles to even enhance and prolong the therapeutic effect . conclusions / significance : in conclusion , lentiviral pseudotyped vectors are promising candidates for gene therapy of glioma in patients . the inefficient gene delivery by gammaretroviral vectors is in line with the results obtained in clinical therapy for gbm and thus confirms the high reproducibility of the invasive glioma animal model for translational research ."
a microarray based approach for the identification of common foodborne viruses .,"an oligonucleotide array ( microarray ) incorporating 13,000 elements representing selected strains of hepatitis a virus ( hav ) , human coxsackieviruses a and b ( cva and cvb ) , genogroups i and ii of norovirus ( nv ) , and human rotavirus ( rv ) gene segments 3,4,10 , and 11 was designed based on the principle of tiling . each oligonucleotide was 29 bases long , starting at every 5th base of every sequence , resulting in an overlap of 24 bases in two consecutive oligonucleotides . the applicability of the array for virus identification was examined using pcr amplified products from multiple hav and cv strains . pcr products labeled with biotin were hybridized to the array , and the biotin was detected using a brief reaction with cy3 - labeled streptavidin , the array subjected to laser scanning , and the hybridization data plotted as fluorescence intensity against each oligonucleotide in the array . the combined signal intensities of all probes representing a particular strain of virus were calculated and plotted against all virus strains identified on a linear representation of the array . the profile of the total signal intensity identified the strain that is most likely represented in the amplified cdna target . the results obtained with hav and cv indicated that the hybridization profile thus generated can be used to identify closely related viral strains . this represents a significant improvement over current methods for virus identification using pcr amplification and amplicon sequencing ."
is the risk of multiple sclerosis related to the ‘ biography ’ of the immune system ?,"multiple sclerosis ( ms ) with onset in childhood offers a unique opportunity to study the infectious background of this disease but the immune reactions against infectious agents in such children have only recently been investigated . these and other epidemiological studies strongly implicate involvement of one or more infectious agents in the aetiology of ms , with epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) being the prime candidate . rather than being the actual cause of ms , it is more probable that these agents are involved in the development of immunoregulatory pathways . these pathways , if disturbed by hygiene - related factors including an altered sequence of infections , may generate and maintain a deficit within the immunological network that facilitates , to particular early events in the development of ms , preceding the onset of ms disease by years or a decade . a framework that can serve as a guide for further epidemiological , immunologic and molecular biologic investigations is formulated . this approach may shed light on the complex natural history of ms and may lead to rational preventive and therapeutic strategies . it is possible that , in the future , ms could be prevented by vaccination against ebv in early childhood ; the framework is of relevance to the design of an appropriate type of vaccine ."
evidence of recombination and genetic diversity in human rhinoviruses in children with acute respiratory infection .,"background : human rhinoviruses ( hrvs ) are a highly prevalent cause of acute respiratory infection in children . they are classified into at least three species , hrv - a , hrv - b and hrv - c , which are characterized by sequencing the 5 ′ untranslated region ( utr ) or the vp4 / vp2 region of the genome . given the increased interest for novel hrv strain identification and their worldwide distribution , we have carried out clinical and molecular diagnosis of hrv strains in a 2 - year study of children with acute respiratory infection visiting one district hospital in shanghai . methodology / findings : we cloned and sequenced a 924 - nt fragment that covered part of the 5 ′ utr and the vp4 / vp2 capsid genes . sixty - four hrv - infected outpatients were diagnosed amongst 827 children with acute low respiratory tract infection . two samples were co-infected with hrv - a and hrv - b or hrv - c. by comparative analysis of the vp4 / vp2 sequences of the 66 hrvs , we showed a high diversity of strains in hrv - a and hrv - b species , and a prevalence of 51.5 % of strains that belonged to the recently identified hrv - c species . when analyzing a fragment of the 5 ′ utr , we characterized at least two subspecies of hrv - c : hrv - cc , which clustered differently from hrv - a and hrv - b , and hrv - ca , which resulted from previous recombination in this region with sequences related to hrv - a . the full - length sequence of one strain of each hrv - ca and hrv - cc subspecies was obtained for comparative analysis . we confirmed the close relationship of their structural proteins but showed apparent additional recombination events in the 2a gene and 3 ′ utr of the hrv - ca strain . double or triple infections with hrv - c and respiratory syncytial virus and / or bocavirus were diagnosed in 33.3 % of the hrv - infected patients , but no correlation with severity of clinical outcome was observed . conclusion : our study showed a high diversity of hrv strains that cause bronchitis and pneumonia in children . a predominance of hrv - c over hrv - a and hrv - b was observed , and two subspecies of hrv - c were identified , the diversity of which seemed to be related to recombination with former hrv - a strains . none of the hrv - c strains appeared to have a higher clinical impact than hrv - a or hrv - b on respiratory compromise ."
reading chest radiographs in the critically ill ( part ii ) : radiography of lung pathologies common in the icu patient .,this is part ii of two series review of reading chest radiographs in the critically ill . conventional chest radiography remains the cornerstone of day to day management of the critically ill occasionally supplemented by computed tomography or ultrasound for specific indications . in this second review we discuss radiographic findings of cardiopulmonary disorders common in the intensive care patient and suggest guidelines for interpretation based not only on imaging but also on the pathophysiology and clinical grounds .
cytomegalovirus infection in critically ill patients : a systematic review .,"introduction : the precise role of cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) infection in contributing to outcomes in critically ill immunocompetent patients has not been fully defined . methods : studies in which critically ill immunocompetent adults were monitored for cmv infection in the intensive care unit ( icu ) were reviewed . results : cmv infection occurs in 0 to 36 % of critically ill patients , mostly between 4 and 12 days after icu admission . potential risk factors for cmv infection include sepsis , requirement of mechanical ventilation , and transfusions . prolonged mechanical ventilation ( 21 to 39 days vs. 13 to 24 days ) and duration of icu stay ( 33 to 69 days vs. 22 to 48 days ) correlated significantly with a higher risk of cmv infection . mortality rates in patients with cmv infection were higher in some but not all studies . whether cmv produces febrile syndrome or end - organ disease directly in these patients is not known . conclusions : cmv infection frequently occurs in critically ill immunocompetent patients and may be associated with poor outcomes . further studies are warranted to identify subsets of patients who are likely to develop cmv infection and to determine the impact of antiviral agents on clinically meaningful outcomes in these patients ."
heliox reduces respiratory system resistance in respiratory syncytial virus induced respiratory failure .,"introduction : respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) lower respiratory tract disease is characterised by narrowing of the airways resulting in increased airway resistance , air - trapping and respiratory acidosis . these problems might be overcome using helium - oxygen gas mixture . however , the effect of mechanical ventilation with heliox in these patients is unclear . the objective of this prospective cross-over study was to determine the effects of mechanical ventilation with heliox 60/40 versus conventional gas on respiratory system resistance , air - trapping and co2 removal . methods : mechanically ventilated , sedated and paralyzed infants with proven rsv were enrolled within 24 hours after paediatric intensive care unit ( picu ) admission . at t = 0 , respiratory system mechanics including respiratory system compliance and resistance , and peak expiratory flow rate were measured with the avea ventilator . the measurements were repeated at each interval ( after 30 minutes of ventilation with heliox , after 30 minutes of ventilation with nitrox and again after 30 minutes of ventilation with heliox ) . indices of gas exchange ( ventilation and oxygenation index ) were calculated at each interval . air - trapping ( defined by relative change in end - expiratory lung volume ) was determined by electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) at each interval . results : thirteen infants were enrolled . in nine , eit measurements were performed . mechanical ventilation with heliox significantly decreased respiratory system resistance . this was not accompanied by an improved co2 elimination , decreased peak expiratory flow rate or decreased end - expiratory lung volume . importantly , oxygenation remained unaltered throughout the experimental protocol . conclusions : respiratory system resistance is significantly decreased by mechanical ventilation with heliox ( iscrtn98152468 ) ."
